In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years.

In the Information Age we often face a lot of misinformation, and gun control is unfortunately often the poster child of misinformation.Here are some of the ways you are being misled.\n\n1. \u201cAssault Weapons\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term \u201cassault weapon\u201d is a made-up political term. AR-15\u2019s are not military rifles; so unscrupulous politicians refer to them as \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons.\u201d \u2018Style\u2019 \u2013 as in cosmetic appearance \u2013 is the only true word in that description. The Military uses the M4A1 carbine rifle, which looks outwardly very much like an AR-15, but they do not have the same functionality; AR-15s are not machine guns, though the terminology used is meant to imply they are. Senator Diane Feinstein (R-Calif.) says AR-15\u2019s are designed for killing as many people in close quarters combat as possible, when in fact the AR-15 is an intermediate to distance rifle with a range of 400-600m. Feinstein and others claim AR-15\u2019s are not used for hunting; but in fact there are dozens of varieties of AR-15 used for hunting everything from varmint/small game to deer, elk, and dangerous game. The AR-15 is not the weapon of choice for most mass shooters according to James Alan Fox, a highly respected criminologist from Northeastern University in Boston; handguns are. In fact, rifle homicides comprise a very small amount of homicides, accounting for less than 3% of homicides (323 out of 12,664 in 2011) mass shootings or otherwise.\n\n2. \u201cHigh Capacity Magazines\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome politicians would have us believe that so-called \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are responsible for a wave of death sweeping the nation. Academic, scholarly research shows the vast majority of homicides average four shots with less than 10 shots fired. While the Aurora shooter infamously used a 100-round magazine drum, these are novelty items that are prone to jam. In fact, it did jam probably saving lives. But mass shooters don\u2019t need 100-round magazines to commit atrocity \u2013 the shooters at Virginia Tech and Columbine used 10-round magazines, they just brought a lot of them (17 and 13 respectively). James Alan Fox states mass shooters often meticulously plan their attacks in advance; a high capacity magazine ban will not deter them as Virginia Tech and Columbine illustrate.\n\n3. Gun Show \u201cLoophole\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral people, including President Obama have stated that 40% of guns were bought via \u201cgun show loopholes.\u201d This is not true. For one, the term \u201cgun show loophole\u201d implies that people are deviously getting around something when in actuality; it is just selling personal private property and is not illegal or nefarious. Additionally, private sales may not actually occur at a gun show at all. More important than loose terminology is that this claim is based on a study from 1994 of 251 people. The Washington Post evaluated this claim with the study\u2019s original authors and says the president distorted the truth. The actual range is 14%-22% with a plus or minus error margin of 6%. This means the final accurate range of this study is as low as 8%, but no more than 28%; neither figure is 40%. Further, it\u2019s implied that closing private sales would solve the issue of criminals obtaining guns; it doesn\u2019t. It fails to address illegal trafficking and straw man purchases. A Department of Justice study indicates that 78.8% of criminals get guns from friends or family (39.6%) or from the street/illegally (39.2%). To this point, the FBI states there are 1.2 million gang members in U.S. and that gangs illegally traffic guns as addition to narcotics.\n\n4. Mass Shootings Are Not Increasing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, Mother Jones and others have claimed that mass shootings are increasing. Once again not true. James Alan Fox\u2019s analysis of the Mother Jones\u2018 study indicates they left out mass murders which made it seem there was an increase after the Federal assault weapon ban expired (they\u2019ve updated their story since). Some mass murders receive more media attention than others, however the number has been consistently about 20 annually since 1976. The number dead from these mass shootings fluctuates from about 25 to 150, depending on the year (Fox\u2019s chart is shown above). In 2012, it was less than 100. Though tragic, this represents a fraction of 1% of homicides. In recent years, homicides by raw number peaked in 1991 at 24,700; it\u2019s dropped in half since, and the homicide rate per 100,000 people today is less than it was even in 1900 (see below).\n\n5. Anti-Gun Organizations Lump in Suicide & Injuries With Crime Data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a mass murder shooting anti-gun organizations like the Brady campaign inevitably call for gun restrictions; these organizations also cite gun violence data other than crime data to include suicides and injuries. This is misleading. Although accidents and suicide are public health concerns, it is disingenuous to include them with homicide in response to a horrific crime. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), suicide rates have crept up slightly 2000-2009, but are still lower than the rate per 100,000 from 1950-1990. It\u2019s not accurate to say guns contribute to suicide causal factors since the rate is lower now. And ultimately, legislation aimed to prevent crime by banning weapons and limiting magazine capacity has no reasonable connection to either suicide or accidents. We ought to compare apples to apples: suicide with suicide prevention, accidents with safety programs, and homicide with policy that would realistically reduce homicide.\n\n6. Too Many Are Being Killed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement is political gaming and wordplay. How many dead would be okay? Who wouldn\u2019t want less murder? Ideally, zero would be the goal, but that begs the question of how to prevent any tendency of violence in humans. This phrase is not only meaningless in terms of contributing to policy that achieves a positive end result, but also dangerous in that the appeal to emotion runs the risk of circumventing genuine solution in favor of sound byte. It makes sense to try to achieve goals with policies other than those proven to be ineffective, as the previous Federal assault weapons ban was. Lastly, homicides are at an all time low.\n\n7. False Zero-Sum Dichotomy \u2013 \u201cEither/Or\u201d:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamous anti-gun rights advocate New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, \u201cI want the Congress to have to stand up and say \u2018I\u2019m with the NRA and support killing our children\u2019, or \u2018No'\u201d (Time magazine, January 28, 2013, p.30). On CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan, Congressman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said, \u201cthe NRA is enablers of mass murder.\u201d This overly simplistic incendiary rhetoric does nothing to further our national discussion, and falsely frames the debate as a zero-sum, winner-take-all, \u2018either/or\u2019 proposition \u2013 either you hug a gun or hug a kid, but you couldn\u2019t possibly be for both gun rights and your child\u2019s safety. That is preposterous. The NRA is not \u201cthe gun industry,\u201d and preservation of the Second Amendment is not of interest only to gun manufacturers. Nearly half of NRA funding comes from individual donors. The NRA is comprised of average people who want safe neighborhoods, schools, and streets. Rather than offer ridiculous false dichotomy and grandstanding, we should be looking for genuine solutions.\n\nBONUS: We Need More Laws:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the granddaddy lie. We already have a lot of laws. It\u2019s illegal to kill your mom, steal a gun, take that gun onto school property, forcibly break and enter, and murder kids. We already have laws preventing mentally ill & felons from obtaining guns, and we have a background check system (NICS). The Sandy Hook shooter was denied to legally purchase a gun because of the NICS system. We tried a federal assault weapons ban (AWB) before. What we do need is better enforcement of existing laws. Congress has not fully funded NICS. Many states do not fully report felony and mental health data to NICS. The Justice Department only prosecutes a fraction of those who criminally falsify background check forms. We desperately need to engage in genuine discussion about real solutions to the violence problem. These solutions are not likely to yield instantaneous results, or win the next election cycle; yet it is what we would do if we were serious about addressing the issue. The underlying causes include: gang activity, which accounts for 48-90% of violent crime depending on jurisdiction; drug abuse, the single biggest predictor of violence with-or-without mental illness; concentrated urban population and poverty; and mental illness, including de-institutionalization, treatment and intervention, and other facets of mental health.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com.

In the 137 page affidavit, Yee is a suspected middle man between terrorist groups in the Mindanao region of the Philippines, supplying high caliber weaponry (including machine guns and rocket launchers) to Chinese-American organized crime figures in the United States. The affidavit spoke of an elaborate multinational effort involving criminal elements in North Africa and Sicily, as well as US gangsters in New Jersey.Yee is also accused of introducing prospective campaign donors (undercover FBI agents, unbeknownst to Yee) and state legislators who had influence over medical marijuana legislation. In exchange for his services, Yee received cash campaign donations that far exceeded legal limits \u2014 and were paid by the FBI.\n\nThe affidavit says that in August 2013, a prominent California political consultant who had been working to raise money for Yee\u2019s campaigns told a prospective donor \u2014 an undercover federal agent \u2014 that Yee \u201chad a contact who deals in arms trafficking.\u201d\n\nIn exchange for campaign contributions, according to the affidavit, Yee would \u201cfacilitate a meeting with the arms dealer\u201d so that the donor could buy a large number of weapons. The firearms would be imported through a port in Newark, N.J. At one meeting, the affidavit said, Yee and the prospective donor discussed \u201cdetails of the specific types of weapons.\u201d\n\nYee and his cohorts were accused of participating in an international crime ring that, that in addition to weapons smuggling, traded in cocaine and other drugs, illegal marijuana \u201cgrows\u201d and transporting stolen liquor and other goods to China.\n\nYee has extensive connections in the Philippines. Among those suspected in involvement are the groups responsible for the\n\ninfamous 2009 Maguindanao (also referred to as Ampatuan) Massacre. While the 58 victims were on their way to file a certificate of candidacy for Esmael Mangudadatu, vice mayor of Buluan town, they were kidnapped and brutally killed. Mangudadatu was challenging Datu Unsay mayor Andal Ampatuan, Jr., son of the incumbent Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan, Sr. and member of one of Mindanao\u2019s leading Muslim political clans, in the forthcoming Maguindanao gubernatorial election part of the national elections in 2010. The people killed included Mangudadatu\u2019s wife, his two sisters, journalists, lawyers, aides, and motorists who were witnesses or were mistakenly identified as part of the convoy.\n\nWhile the investigation and subsequent trials will determine the level of Yee\u2019s involvement, if any, he did offer his sentiments of condolence at a Fil-Am memorial for the victims of the tragedy.\n\n\u201cLet us never forget the ultimate sacrifice that these journalists made for the public good,\u201d said Yee. Yee paid tribute to the journalist victims of the massacre and the four who died during the recent typhoon. \u201cThey died in the line of duty,\u201d said Austin Baul, president of the the Filipino American Community of Los Angeles. \u201cThey knew full well that their mission was fraught with peril yet they persisted to fulfill their duty to the people.\u201d\n\nDignitas News Service has also discovered his involvement with Philippine News, a news source with offices in both the United States and the Philippines. On their web site, he is listed under the \u201cColumnists and Contributors\u201d list.\n\nYee is the third Democrat California State Senator to be arrested in 2014.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nStumbleUpon\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/10916086/The-scandal-of-fiddled-global-warming-data.html", "The scandal of fiddled global warming data", "When future generations try to understand how the world got carried away around the end of the 20th century by the panic over global warming, few things will amaze them more than the part played in stoking up the scare by the fiddling of official temperature data. There was already much evidence of this seven years ago, when I was writing my history of the scare, The Real Global Warming Disaster. But now another damning example has been uncovered by Steven Goddard\u2019s US blog Real Science, showing how shamelessly manipulated has been one of the world\u2019s most influential climate records, the graph of US surface temperature records published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nGoddard shows how, in recent years, NOAA\u2019s US Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) has been \u201cadjusting\u201d its record by replacing real temperatures with data \u201cfabricated\u201d by computer models. The effect of this has been to downgrade earlier temperatures and to exaggerate those from recent decades, to give the impression that the Earth has been warming up much more than is justified by the actual data. In several posts headed \u201cData tampering at USHCN/GISS\u201d, Goddard compares the currently published temperature graphs with those based only on temperatures measured at the time. These show that the US has actually been cooling since the Thirties, the hottest decade on record; whereas the latest graph, nearly half of it based on \u201cfabricated\u201d data, shows it to have been warming at a rate equivalent to more than 3 degrees centigrade per century.\n\nWhen I first began examining the global-warming scare, I found nothing more puzzling than the way officially approved scientists kept on being shown to have finagled their data, as in that ludicrous \u201chockey stick\u201d graph, pretending to prove that the world had suddenly become much hotter than at any time in 1,000 years. Any theory needing to rely so consistently on fudging the evidence, I concluded, must be looked on not as science at all, but as simply a rather alarming case study in the aberrations of group psychology."], ["http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-2016-wall-street-reaction-213614?utm_content=bufferbd674&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer", "Wall Street's latest panic: Trump could win", "NEW YORK \u2014 Wall Street is growing increasingly terrified that Donald Trump \u2014 once viewed as an amusing summertime distraction \u2014 could actually win the Republican nomination for president.\n\nThe real estate billionaire, who took another populist shot on Sunday by ripping into lavish executive pay, continues to rise in the polls. Would-be Wall Street saviors like Jeb Bush are languishing in single digits. The belief that Trump's candidacy would quickly fade is now evaporating in a wave of fear.\n\n\u201cI held four lunches for investors in August and at the first one everyone assumed Trump would implode,\u201d said Byron Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners and a senior figure on Wall Street. \u201cBy the fourth one everyone was taking him very seriously. He taps into frustrations that are very real and he is a master manipulator of the media.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of one large Wall Street firm, who declined to be identified by name criticizing the GOP front-runner, said the assumption in the financial industry remains that something will eventually knock Trump off and send voters toward a more establishment candidate. But that assumption is no longer held with strong conviction. And a dozen Wall Street executives interviewed for this article could not say what might dent Trump's appeal or when it might happen.\n\n\"I don't know anyone who is a Donald Trump supporter. I don\u2019t know anyone who knows anyone who is a Donald Trump supporter. They are like this huge mystery group,\u201d the CEO said. \"So it's a combination of shock and bewilderment. No one really knows why this is happening. But my own belief is that the laws of gravity will apply and those who are prepared to run the marathon will benefit when Trump drops out at mile 22. Right now people think Trump is pretty hilarious but the longer it goes on the more frightening it gets.\"\n\nThe latest frightening broadside for the Wall Street class came on Sunday when Trump said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that executive pay in America is \u201ca complete joke\u201d and promised to raise taxes on \u201cthe hedge fund guys.\u201d In a statement sent to POLITICO on Monday from his campaign, Trump relished in the attacks from Wall Street, singling out both Bush and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, another favorite on Wall Street.\n\n\"Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton will continue to let Wall Street and the 'hedge fund guys' rip off the people by paying no or very little in taxes,\" Trump said. \"They have total and complete control of Hillary, Jeb and others running. My campaign is self- funded. The only people that have control of me are the people of the United States.\"\n\nThe comments on Wall Street were relatively tame in comparison with his fiery rhetoric about deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants within two years and building a giant border wall with Mexico. The billionaire also recently ripped former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina\u2019s looks, saying they would make her unelectable.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s skill at tapping into populist discontent with all major U.S. institutions \u2014 including Wall Street \u2014 has financial executives increasingly dismayed at the GOP front-runner\u2019s staying power and long-term impact on the party even if he doesn\u2019t get the nomination.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Trump is going to win, but I do worry about all the damage being done to Republicans among Hispanics and women by him being such an idiot,\u201d said a senior executive and major GOP fundraiser at a large bank who also declined to be identified by name. \u201cEveryone thinks he is a buffoon and a bombastic loudmouth who won\u2019t be around at the end. But the concern is that he is still at 30 in the polls and he is going to hang around for a while and do a great deal of damage.\u201d\n\nSo far there is no organized effort on Wall Street to mount a \u201cstop Trump\u201d campaign.\n\nMostly such efforts entail funneling even more money to Bush, whose super PAC, Right to Rise, raised more than $100 million through the first six months of the year. To a lesser extent, Wall Street money continues to flow to Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, though Walker is largely viewed as increasingly marginalized in the race.\n\nSupporters of Bush say they still believe that the former Florida governor\u2019s numbers will begin to move when the campaign starts deploying some of its huge war chest to run television ads in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and other early primary and caucus states. And while they say Bush needs a strong performance at Wednesday night\u2019s debate, they don\u2019t expect Bush to throw haymakers Trump\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cYes I\u2019m a little worried about how poorly Jeb is doing,\u201d said a second Wall Street CEO who is backing the former Florida governor but would not speak on the record. \u201cHopefully it will get better over time. But there is no point trading insults with Trump. There is a saying that you don\u2019t wrestle with pigs because you just get dirty and the pig loves it.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason Wall Street executives won\u2019t go on the record about Trump is that they believe criticizing him will only drive his numbers higher. Americans continue to hold big banks in low regard following the financial crisis. And Trump\u2019s momentum is built on a generalized hostility to the political and corporate establishment.\n\nTrump can rip into executive compensation in part because he built his own empire and brand and his Trump Organization is privately held, so he can\u2019t be accused of using shareholders' money to enrich himself, a cudgel often used to attack high executive pay at public companies. And establishment attacks would likely just make him stronger.\n\n\u201cMost people in the New York business community don\u2019t really like to speak publicly about politicians and especially not Trump, because he will just jump ugly all over them,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the New York City Partnership, a group that includes many of the city\u2019s top business leaders. \u201cTrump has never really been part of the New York City business community or particularly engaged with the real estate community. There\u2019s certainly no close set of relations there. He\u2019s really a lone wolf. And a lot of these people thought Jeb Bush was a shoo-in and they are upset now because they have already thrown in with him and he is looking a little wilted.\u201d\n\nTrump is not entirely without Wall Street support.\n\nHe has regularly praised Carl Icahn and said he would make the billionaire investor his first Treasury secretary. Icahn tweeted recently that he would accept the post. He did not respond to a request for comment on Trump.\n\nThe frustration on Wall Street goes beyond just Trump\u2019s rise and staying power. The industry\u2019s other preferred candidate, Clinton, is also suffering under the populist wave, losing ground to independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described socialist and outspoken Wall Street critic.\n\nThe industry began this election cycle confident that a GOP candidate like Bush would win, and offer some reprieve from populist anger. And if that didn\u2019t happen they would at least get Clinton, who has long and deep ties to the industry and is viewed as largely moderate on financial regulation.\n\nBoth Bush and Clinton have tacked populist with pledges to increase taxes on some wealthy investors. But they are still both establishment-friendly, with policies on trade, immigration and other issues that line up closely with elite opinion. And Wall Street does not view either candidate as likely to use the office to further stoke populist resentments.\n\n\u201cNeither of them are doing very well right now,\u201d said one Wall Street Democrat of Bush and Clinton. \u201cBoth Trump and Sanders have done a pretty great job tapping into this sense of frustration not just with Wall Street but with all of the establishment.\u201d\n\nOne person who might benefit from Trump\u2019s rise and Bush\u2019s current stagnation is Kasich, who worked for seven years at Lehman Brothers \u2014 though in an Ohio office \u2014 and is viewed as something of an establishment-populist hybrid given his folksy demeanor and heartland background.\n\n\u201cKasich is a true businessman in contrast to Trump. He is the businessman candidate and he\u2019s pretty compelling in part because Jeb has taken such a beating,\u201d said Wylde. \u201cI\u2019ve set up a meet- and -greet with Governor Kasich and I\u2019ve already got a sellout crowd.\u201d\n\n"], ["http://www.jacksnewswatch.com/2015/09/20/mccarthy-why-gop-congressional-leaders-support-the-iran-deal-in-fact-follow-the-money/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "McCarthy: Why GOP Congressional Leaders Support the Iran Deal in Fact \u2014 Follow the Money", "\u201cWhy on earth would Republicans do that?\u201d That is a question I\u2019ve been asked at least a dozen times since illustrating that the GOP has played a cynical game in connection with President Obama\u2019s Iran deal.\n\n\u201cFollow the money\u201d is a common answer to questions about political motivation.

The rigged law authorized Obama to lift sanctions as long as Republicans could not pass a resolution of disapproval. As Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, and other GOP leaders well knew, there was no way they would ever be able to enact a disapproval resolution over Obama\u2019s veto. But the process choreographed by Corker-Cardin meant they would be able to complain about the deal and vote to disapprove it \u2014 thereby creating the impression that they were staunchly against the lifting of sanctions that they had already authorized.\n\n[Interesting Read]"], ["http://www.friendlydb.com/", "social search engine free speech lives here", "Welcome\n\nfriendlydb is social...

Let me first take you back in 1987 when I personally saw this legendary woman. She came to the Philippines to inaugurate the Home for the Dying. This is one of the many homes she was operating in more than 100 countries all across the world. I was a high school seminarian when she spoke to us in our chapel. I was one of the many who were spiritually and deeply moved by her saintly presence. What I could not forget was her message. She said something like this, \u201cWe cannot say we love God when we don\u2019t even love our neighbors.\u201d I was sixteen years old at that time but her simple and sincere words made a lasting impression in my mind even after 26 years.\n\nDuring her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 1979, she said this statement: \u201cThe greatest destroyer of peace today is the cry of the innocent unborn child. If a mother can murder her own child, in her own womb, what is left for you and for me to kill each other?\u201d Undoubtedly, she referred to abortion which is today an estimated 40 to 50 million yearly cases. I tried very hard to fathom on what is the connection between peace and abortion.\n\nHere comes the ISIS, described by the United Nations as a terrorist group. For the past weeks, they killed thousands of people including the beheading of two American Journalists and one British Humanitarian Aid Worker. I have an intuition that the men of this group are survivors of abortion. The reason is because of the discussion about abortion given by my College Professor in Psychology which I carry with me even today. He said that there are a lot of women who attempted to kill their unborn babies by taking abortifacients. However, these babies survived. The children who survived the hidden killing intention of their mothers usually become criminals in their adulthood. On the other hand, men who impregnated women without assuming the responsibility of being a father, are usually coming from broken families. This means that they could also be survivors of abortion. He quoted a line from a controversial Psychologist, John B. Watson, \u201cGive me two children. The first one, I will make him a criminal and the other one, I will make him a saint.\u201d\n\nNow I understand why Mother Teresa said that abortion is the greatest destroyer of peace. The men of ISIS could have this unresolved feeling of being unwanted buried in their subconscious when they were in the wombs of their mothers. What they are doing in the present is asserting their need to be recognized in the place of the society although in a negative way. So let us think many times before entering into sexual intercourse. Great responsibility of raising a child starts from the day of conception.\n\nFor almost five decades, Mother Teresa together with the sisters of the Missionaries of Charity gave homes for these children by sending a message to the world that she was fighting abortion by adoption. What if she is still alive today? What message could she give to the soldiers of ISIS who killed children by burying them alive along with women last Aug. 10, 2014? Would her saintly charisma finally end their atrocities to humanity?\n\nBy Ryan L Gavini\n\nDignitas News Service Contributor\n\nSources:\n\nNobelPrize\n\nWorldOmeters\n\nMotherTeresaAbortionSpeech_(via MichaelJacquesYouTube)\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nStumbleUpon\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], ["http://www.jihadwatch.org/2015/09/new-york-muslim-pledged-allegiance-to-the-islamic-state", "New York Muslim pledged allegiance to the Islamic State", "But\u2026but\u2026John Kerry and David Cameron and Bill O\u2019Reilly and the U.S. Catholic bishops and so many other unimpeachable authorities all assure us that the Islamic State has nothing \u2014 nothing! \u2014 to do with Islam!

All but three of them have been United States senators or state governors at some point in their careers. The other three, according to a Morning Consult poll of people who watched the 11 leading contenders debate this past Wednesday, are leading the race.\n\nA couple of big caveats: this is Morning Consult's first campaign season and it isn't yet a proven pollster, and the people who watched the Republican debates may not represent the party's primary electorate as a whole. But when you consider that this is a poll of Republicans (and independents who plan to vote in Republican primaries) who are engaged enough to watch an early debate \u2014 who one would think are the most engaged voters out there \u2014 it gets even more worrisome for the establishment.\n\nHere are four terrible signs for the GOP establishment in the poll, and one good one:\n\n1) Political n00bs get an outright majority of debate-watchers' support\n\n36 percent of poll respondents support Donald Trump; 12 percent support Ben Carson; and 10 percent support Carly Fiorina. All together, that's 58 percent of Republican debate-watchers who support one of the three candidates in the race with no experience in elected office whatsoever. To put it another way, none of the twelve candidates in the field with political experience managed to crack 10 percent of the vote.\n\n2) Fiorina's rising \u2014 but she's not taking Trump's support\n\nMost observers, including the poll's respondents, agreed Fiorina won the debate. Now, many pundits are portraying her as the new candidate with momentum \u2014 implying that she's seizing it from Trump.\n\nBut Trump not only failed to lose support after a debate where he was largely irrelevant to the proceedings, he actually gained 5 percentage points since the last Morning Connect poll was conducted a week ago. If neither Fiorina's rise nor his own debate performance has hurt Trump, it's getting hard to imagine what can.\n\n3) Jeb Bush's numbers are dismal \u2014 and Scott Walker's are even worse\n\n6 percent of poll respondents said they would vote for Jeb Bush. That ties him with Chris Christie for sixth place (behind Trump, Carson and Fiorina, as well as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio). Just like Trump is somehow still gaining support, Bush is somehow still losing it.\n\nIt is definitely bad news for the Republican establishment that their preferred candidate is getting 6 percent in the polls. But the man who was supposed to be his \"conservative challenger\" is doing even worse. Scott Walker, who when the race started was the closest thing to the candidate of the conservative movement, is polling at 1 percent. He is tied with former New York Governor George Pataki.\n\n4) The highest-polling elected official is Ted Cruz\n\nTed Cruz made his name, nationally, fighting the leadership of his own party in the Senate in the floor fight that resulted in the 2011 government shutdown. Ted Cruz is notoriously disliked by his Republican Senate colleagues. Ted Cruz's strategy over the last few months has been to buddy up with Donald Trump \u2014 even appearing at a rally in DC against the Iran nuclear deal together \u2014 in the hopes that when (or if) Trump's candidacy fades, Cruz will swoop in and take his support. Ted Cruz is, in other words, running against the fact that he is an elected official. Ted Cruz is polling better than all the other elected officials.\n\n5) But what if all of this is just very good news for Marco Rubio?\n\nIf you are an establishment Republican donor, all of this looks pretty dismal to you. But there is hope! After yet another quietly competent debate performance, Marco Rubio \u2014 who was once languishing with Christie and Rand Paul \u2014 is rising in the polls and, according to Morning Connect, right behind Cruz.\n\nRubio is incredibly amenable to conservative establishment preferences. In fact, the biggest problem with his candidacy so far was that some of the people who might support Rubio were instead backing Jeb Bush. In a happy coincidence, just as Bush's campaign is looking hopeless \u2014 and just as it's becoming clear that the anti-establishment candidates aren't going to take each other out on their own \u2014 Rubio's looking a little better. In other words, Marco Rubio has a pretty strong case that if the GOP donor base wants to take down Donald Trump, he, and not Bush, is the candidate they should bet on."], ["http://benybs.blogspot.com/2015/03/obamas-amnesty-all-in-just-may-be.html", "#obama's #amnesty \"All In\" just may be finally stopped by the #Law #pjnet #ccot #tcot", "A Leader envisions an end-state, motivates, plans & coordinates the judicious use of resources (onto a timeline) that influence a desired (course of) action & maintains flow until a desired standard is achieved or diminishing returns realized.

From a humanitarian point of view -- and humanitarianism is the chief reason being cited in accepting refugees -- Christians should receive top priority simply because they are the most persecuted group in the Middle East -- well before the Islamic State phenomenon came into being. As Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop put it, \u201cI think that Christian minorities are being persecuted in Syria and even if the conflict were over they would still be persecuted.\u201d\n\nIndeed. While they are especially targeted by the Islamic State, before the new \u201ccaliphate\u201d was established, Christians were and continue to be targeted by Muslims -- Muslim mobs, Muslim individuals, Muslim regimes, and Muslim terrorists, from Muslim countries of all races (Arab, African, Asian, etc.) -- and for the same reason: Christians are infidel number one. See Crucified Again: Exposing Islam\u2019s New War on Christians for hundreds of anecdotes before the rise of ISIS as well as the Muslim doctrines that create such hate and contempt for Christians.\n\nConversely, Muslim refugees -- as opposed to the many ISIS and other jihadi infiltrators posing as \u201crefugees\u201d -- are not fleeing direct persecution, but chaos created by the violent and supremacist teachings of their own religion, Islam. It\u2019s not for nothing that Samuel Huntington famously pointed out that \u201cIslam\u2019s borders are bloody, and so are its innards.\u201d This means that when Muslims enter Western nations, chaos, persecution, and mayhem follow. Take a look at those West European cities -- for example, Londonistan -- that already have a large Muslim population for an idea.\n\nMuslim persecution of Christians has been further enabled by Western policies, especially those of the Obama administration. In other words, Western nations should accept Christian refugees on the basis that Western meddling in the Middle East is directly responsible for exacerbating the plight of Christian minorities. After all, Christians did not flee from Bashar Assad\u2019s Syria, or Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq, or Muamar Gaddafi\u2019s Libya. Their systematic persecution began in earnest after the U.S. and others interfered in those nations in the name of \u201cdemocracy.\u201d All they did is unleash the jihadi forces that the dictators had long kept suppressed. Now the Islamic State is deeply embedded in all three nations, enslaving, raping, and slaughtering countless Christian \u201cinfidels\u201d and other minorities.\n\nThus if the West is responsible for unleashing the full-blown jihad on Christians, surely it is the latter that the West should prioritize, from a humanitarian point of view.\n\nUnlike Muslims, or even Yazidis, Christians are easily assimilated in Western countries, due to their shared Christian heritage. As Slovakia, which prefers Christian refugees, correctly points out, Muslims would not fit in, including because there are no mosques in the Slavic nation. Conversely, \u201cSlovakia as a Christian country can really help Christians from Syria to find a new home in Slovakia,\u201d said an interior minister.\n\nThis too is common sense. The same Christian teachings that molded Europe over the centuries are the same ones that mold Middle Eastern Christians -- whether Orthodox, Catholic, or Protestant. As San Diego\u2019s Father Noel said in the context of the Iraqi Christian refugees who managed to flee ISIS but are now rotting in a U.S. detention center, Mideast Christians \u201cwho come here [America] \u2018want to be good citizens\u2019 and many who came here a decade ago are now lawyers, teachers, or other productive members of society.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Muslims follow a completely different blueprint, the Koran -- which condemns Christians by name, calls for constant war (jihad) against all non-Muslims, and advocates any number of distinctly anti-Western practices. Hence it is no surprise that many Muslim asylum seekers are anti-Western at heart, if not members of jihadi organizations.\n\nMideast Christians bring trustworthy language and cultural skills that are beneficial to the West. They understand the Middle Eastern -- including Islamic -- mindset and can help the West understand it. Moreover, unlike Muslims, Christians have no \u201cconflicting loyalty\u201d issues: Islamic law forbids Muslims from aiding \u201cinfidels\u201d against fellow Muslims (click here to see some of the treachery this leads to in the U.S. and here to see the treachery Christians have suffered from their longtime Muslim neighbors and \u201cfriends\u201d). Indeed, an entire book about how \u201cdouble agent\u201d Muslims have infiltrated every corner of the U.S. government exists. No such threat exists among Mideast Christians. They too render unto God what is God\u2019s and unto Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s.\n\nFinally, it goes without saying that Mideast Christians have no sympathy for the very people and ideology that made their lives a living hell -- the very people and ideology that are also hostile to everything in the West. Thus a win-win: the West and Mideast Christians complement each other, if only in that they share the same foe.\n\nAll the above reasons -- from those that offer humanitarian relief to the true victims of persecution, to those that offer benefits to the West -- are unassailable in their logic and wisdom. Yet, because Western progressives prioritize politically correct ideals and fantasies over stark reality, there is little chance that they will be considered.\n\nQuite the reverse: in America and Britain persecuted Christians are \u201cat the bottom of the heap\u201d of refugees to be granted asylum. Muslims receive top priority. Since January 2015, the U.S. has granted asylum to approximately six Muslims for every Christian it takes in.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: for the progressive mindset -- which dominates Western governments, media, and academia -- taking in refugees has little to do with altruism and everything to do egoism: it matters little who is really being persecuted.\n\nNo, what\u2019s important is that we \u201cfeel good\u201d about ourselves. By taking in \u201cforeign\u201d Muslims, as opposed to \u201csiding\u201d with \u201cfamiliar\u201d Christians, progressives get to feel \u201cenlightened,\u201d \u201copen-minded,\u201d \u201ctolerant,\u201d and \u201cmulticultural\u201d -- and that\u2019s all that matters here.\n\nMeanwhile, reality quietly marches on: the same Islamic mentality that slaughters \u201cinfidel\u201d Christians in the Middle East is welcomed into the West with open arms.\n\nRaymond Ibrahim, author of Crucified Again: Exposing Islam\u2019s New War on Christians, is a Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center and Judith Friedman Rosen Writing Fellow at the Middle East Forum"], ["http://benybs.blogspot.com/2015/03/obamas-amnesty-all-in-just-may-be.html", "#obama's #amnesty \"All In\" just may be finally stopped by the #Law #pjnet #ccot #tcot", "A Leader envisions an end-state, motivates, plans & coordinates the judicious use of resources (onto a timeline) that influence a desired (course of) action & maintains flow until a desired standard is achieved or diminishing returns realized.

Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

The American people have every right to be suspicious of him Obama\u2019s Muslim Identity By Cliff Kincaid -- Bio and Archives September 19, 2015\n\nComments | Print friendly | Subscribe | Email Us\n\n\n\nAn ordinary citizen who identified President Barack Obama as a Muslim at a Donald Trump town hall meeting in New Hampshire showed that media brainwashing on the subject has been futile. The people understand that Obama asserts he is a Christian, but they just aren\u2019t buying it. Obama has done too many things to benefit Muslims to convince people that he is not one of them. The latest example was extending an invitation to a Muslim student to come to the White House after he was detained for possessing what appeared to be a bomb. It turned out to be a clock that looked like a bomb. Naturally, the Obama White House treated this as a case of so-called Islamophobia, when pictures of the device demonstrated that care should have been taken and law enforcement should have been called. Obama refuses to identify Islamic terrorism as Islamic terrorism, but is quick to jump to conclusions about the supposedly anti-Islamic character of the American people. This is the mark of someone who is either strongly sympathetic to Islam, or a Muslim himself. Robert Spencer has written an excellent article about Ahmed Mohamed\u2019s suspicious-looking device and uncooperative behavior. Our media are denouncing Trump for failing to \u201ccorrect\u201d the citizen who identified Obama as a Muslim. They flatly assert Obama is a Christian. The issue here is not Trump, but Obama. We have corrected the record many times on this, but it seems that another explanation is warranted. Politicians can say anything about themselves, but it is up to the media to determine if those claims are true. If Obama and his aides had a habit of telling the truth, the claim about Obama being a Christian might be assumed to be true. But as we have noted in the past, \u201cUnfortunately for Obama and his backers, the same Obama campaign apparatus which claimed that he is a baptized Christian asserted that the mysterious \u2018Frank\u2019 in Obama\u2019s book, Dreams from My Father, was just a black civil rights activist. It turned out that \u2018Frank\u2019 was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party member under surveillance by the FBI who served as a mentor for a young Obama in Hawaii.\u201d So what reason is there to believe that Obama is a Christian just because he says so? He doesn\u2019t act or talk like a Christian, and he doesn\u2019t go to church very often. Instead, he acts and talks like a Muslim. Obama acknowledges in Dreams from My Father that his grandfather was a Muslim (page 104) and that he spent two years in a Muslim school in Indonesia studying the Koran (page 154). The Politician Without a Church There is no evidence Obama was baptized, in any formal sense, in Jeremiah Wright\u2019s church. What\u2019s more, there is no evidence that Obama ever specifically rejected Islam. Indeed, Obama could have joined Wright\u2019s church in Chicago without disavowing the Muslim faith. Author Edward Klein notes that Wright told him that he \u201cmade it comfortable\u201d for Obama to accept Christianity \u201cwithout having to renounce his Islamic background.\u201d As we noted in a review of Klein\u2019s book, Wright was asked if he converted Obama from Islam to Christianity, and Wright said, \u201cThat\u2019s hard to tell. I think I convinced him that it was okay for him to make a choice in terms of who he believed Jesus is. And I told him it was really okay and not a putdown of the Muslim part of his family or his Muslim friends.\u201d Obama\u2019s failure to attend church led us to label him \u201cThe Politician Without a Church.\u201d We noted that \u201c...if Obama claims to be a Christian, and the evidence suggests otherwise, it is a significant story. That\u2019s because his alleged Christianity was a factor in his 2008 and 2012 victories.\u201d This is why it\u2019s significant that the American people still aren\u2019t buying the notion of Obama\u2019s alleged Christianity. People have recognized a truth about Obama that the Obama campaign, White House, and the media have tried their best to conceal. Obama\u2019s alleged Christianity \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t challenge anti-Muslim questioner at event\u201d is how CNN framed the controversy over the Trump event in New Hampshire. The questioner asserted that Obama is a Muslim and that Muslims want to kill Americans. Is that anti-Muslim? The British Guardian ran the headline, \u201cDonald Trump fails to correct questioner who calls Obama Muslim.\u201d CBS News ran the story, \u201cTrump declines to correct man who says Obama is Muslim.\u201d If Obama had demonstrated his Christianity through actions and statements, and if there was indisputable evidence that he was baptized a Christian and rejected Islam, the media might have a point. In this case, they do not. The behavior of the media is far more objectionable than a simple observation, based on the facts as he perceived them, from an American citizen about the American President. The record is clear: Obama has lied about his Marxist and Muslim backgrounds. The American people have every right to be suspicious of him.

The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63). This doesn\u2019t mean that it is unlimited, the same as all rights (more on that below). However, the court states that even though gun violence is a problem to be taken seriously, \u201cthe enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table\u201d (p.64).\n\n6. The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this. It\u2019s listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (\u201csecurity of a free state\u201d), then the people need arms: \u201cWhen the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny\u201d (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted \u201cthat history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents\u201d (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: \u201cduring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive\u201d (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens\u2019 militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).\n\n7. The Second Amendment was also meant as a provision to repel a foreign army invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find this one comical, but it\u2019s in there. The court notes one of many reasons for the militia to ensure a free state was \u201cit is useful in repelling invasions\u201d (p.24). This provision, like tyranny, isn\u2019t an everyday occurring use of the right; more like a once-in-a-century (if that) kind of provision. A popular myth from World War II holds Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese navy allegedly said \u201cYou cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\u201d Although there is no evidence of him saying this, there was concern that Japan might invade during WWII. Japan did invade Alaska, which was a U.S. territory at the time, and even today on the West Coast there are still gun embankments from the era (now mostly parks). The fact is that there are over 310 million firearms in the United States as of 2009, making a foreign invasion success less likely (that, and the U.S. military is arguably the strongest in the world).\n\n8. The Second Amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t unlimited: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d (p. 54). The Court upheld restrictions like the prohibition of arms by felons and the mentally ill, and carrying in certain prohibited places like schools and courthouses. What is protected are weapons \u201cin common use of the time\u201d (p.55). This doesn\u2019t mean weapons in common use \u201cat that time,\u201d meaning the 18th Century. The Court said the idea that it would is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\u201d (p.8). The Court\u2019s criteria includes weapons in popular widespread use \u201cthat [are] overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d (p. 56), and \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans\u201d (p. 58).\n\n9. The Second Amendment might require full-blown military arms to fulfill the original intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court didn\u2019t rule specifically on this in D.C. v. Heller, but noting that weapon technology has drastically changed (mentioning modern day bombers and tanks), they stated \u201cthe conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large\u201d (p. 55).\n\nThey further added that \u201cthe fact that modern developments [in modern weaponry] have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right\u201d (p. 56). A full ruling has not been made, as this was not in the scope the court was asked to rule on in the D.C. v. Heller case, but they left the door open for future ruling.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Feb 8, 2013.

The economy is actually larger and growing faster than the official data shows. That\u2019s because of all the illegal activity that is not reported. Some of this illegal business is big business and it is usually for export. The big ones are drugs, jade and timber. The government has tried to limit or at least control all three but because all these activities are mainly in the rebellious tribal north, and often involve powerful economic and political interests in China (the main customer) change is difficult. Officially China wants to stop the illegal export of Burmese drugs, jade and timber to China. Unofficially only the drugs are opposed. Illegal timber and jade from Burma is tolerated because these are legal commodities (once they enter China). Yet illegal logging is a major grievance for the northern tribes and the government will occasionally pressure China to cooperate in curbing the deforestation and damage to tribal lands. The last time China cracked down was in 2005 but as is common with these things the bribes (to local officials and soldiers as well as border guards to allow the timber to reach customers) eventually had their way and now the illegal timber trade is as big as ever and the tribes are increasing the pressure on the government to act. The situation is worse than in 2005 because now the illegal logging has gone deeper into Burma to find the rosewood and teak that is the most profitable. The illegal logging crews have their owned security and will often bribe local soldiers to help out. Sometimes the tribal militias were bribed as well but most of the time the armed tribesmen were not willing to sell out their neighborhood.\n\nThe Burmese Army has long been at the center of most illegal economic activity. Some researchers believe that at least $20 billion has been illegally moved out of Burma during the fifty years of military rule and much more stayed in the country. Almost all of that was military personnel or their gangster and commercial allies. Military families still control a lot of the economy and most of the wealthy families in Burma have a military connection. The illegal cash leaving amounted (on average) to about six percent of GDP. The military may have surrendered much of their political power, but they are hanging on to their considerable personal wealth.\n\nOne reason for the futility of the peace talks with the tribal rebels is the continued power of the generals. Thus while the commander of the army insists that the military will respect the outcome of the November elections everyone believes that this \u201crespect\u201d has limits. The generals say they would accept a new government that wanted to curb the power of the military. This was in response to growing domestic and foreign pressure on the military to give up the veto power it has under the new constitution. The generals have used this veto to \u201cprotect their interests.\u201d This has included blocking \u201chostile\u201d (anti-military) candidates from running for president or attempts by parliament to curb military power. This is all about how the 2008 constitution that guarantees the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament and requires 75 percent of the votes in parliament to get the constitution changed. Many of the generals are reluctant to allow any changes to this because so many Burmese are still angry at the decades of bad behavior by the military governments. Without some control over the government the generals who ran the military dictatorship (and many of their subordinates) could be prosecuted for their crimes. The generals are under a lot of pressure over the constitutional reform issue. Burmese businessmen and foreign investors also back a reduction of military control, mainly because the military is the main source of the widespread corruption that cripples the economy.\n\nThe latest round of peace talks with the tribal rebels in the north are failing for the usual reason; the various tribal factions cannot agree on what terms to accept from the government. Thus some factions are willing to settle for less than other factions. This happens a lot and the army sees it as a major advantage as the tribal rebels are a lot easier to deal with if they are not united. Another reason for delays in a new peace deal is that in some parts of the north (like Shan and Kachin states) the fighting is pretty continuous.\n\nUp in Shan state the army blames the Kokang tribal rebels and their organization (MNDAA) for most of the violence. So far this month at least twenty soldiers and about half as many rebels have died in ambushes and skirmishes up there. The MNDAA wants official recognition, something the government is reluctant to grant. The MNDAA is largely composed of ethnic Chinese who have long lived in northern Burma (as have other Chinese tribes). MNDAA used to be more political (communist) but that disappeared in 1989 when the Burmese Communist Party fell apart as a side effect of the collapse of communism in East Europe. MNDAA made peace with the government in 2009 but like most peace deals up north that did not last because the army kept operating in tribal territory. The government refused to recognize the MNDAA as one of the tribal rebel groups negotiating a ceasefire and this refusal continues to be a problem. The Kohang and MNDAA have become a drug gang as have many of its tribal allies in the north. These included the Shan State Army\u2013South (SSA-S). For years the army has fought the SSA-S for key terrain, usually to control roads that supply and troops and everyone else. The army has also been trying to interfere with the tribal drug operations up north. The SSA-S is allied with the neighboring Wa and these two groups and the MNDAA are making a lot of money producing and smuggling drugs. Opium and heroin production have been revived in the past few years. Production of methamphetamine is huge. Called \"yaba\" (\"crazy drug\") locally, most of it is smuggled out via Thailand. Over the last few years, production of yaba tablets has soared. The meth labs are easier to conceal than poppy fields (opium is the sap of poppy plants) and the meth labs are believed to produce several hundred million tablets a year. The tribal rebels, especially ethnic Chinese tribes (like the Wa and MNDAA) use the profits to buy more weapons for their fighters, and run their rebel organizations. The government has been in a weak bargaining position here but always had the option to declare the militias in violation of the 2012 peace deal and officially renew the fighting. That declaration has not happened yet. TNLA (Taang National Liberation Army) rebels as well as the KIA (Kachin) rebels also support the Kokang rebels. These three groups provide most of the armed opposition to the army in the Chinese border area. Rebels remain active here because China is a major market for heroin and other drugs produced in the north. China is also the source of all the military equipment the rebels need and China has had little success in halting the illegal export of weapons military equipment (including uniforms) to the tribal armies in northern Burma. The money is too good to pass up for local Chinese merchants who have long learned how to deal with directives from their national government. As the ancient saying goes; the mountains are high and the emperor is far away.\n\nDespite the continued violence in Shan state there are parts of the state that have been peaceful enough long enough to lift some restriction. Thus Thailand is reopening a border crossing that has been closed since 2002 because of the fighting. This crossing leads to the Shan state capital and will increase trade and economic activity in Shan state as well as Thailand.\n\nThe violence on the Indian border continues. Lately many Indian rebels have been staying out of their usual hideouts just across the border in Burma. That\u2019s only because in mid-2014 the Burmese army began actively seeking out and attacking the camps of Indian rebels. Often the rebels detect the approach of the Burmese soldiers and flee back into India. There the Indian Army is more active in going after the rebels. Because of a recent agreement, India and Burma are sharing intelligence on armed groups near their mutual border. This cooperation is not uniform all along the border. This month India went public with complaints that in one area at least two Indian rebel camps had been established three and five kilometers inside Burma and local Burmese troops were not cooperating. Apparently bribes, threats or whatever had been used to get some of the cooperation the Indian rebels long enjoyed. India is demanding that the Burmese high command act. So far there has been no action on this matter.\n\nBurma isn\u2019t the only country having problems with rebels using borders to hide behind. Next door in Bangladesh there are also problems, mainly with Burmese rebels setting up camps just inside Bangladesh. The Bangladeshis are not very tolerant of this sort of thing and this month Burmese soldiers were sent to reinforce border guards who were pushing members of the \u201cArakan Army\u201d back into Burma. Arakan State, on the northwest coast, has not had as much tribal violence as states to the east, but the Arakan Army had help from Kachin state tribal rebels and have proved to be a persistent problem on both sides of the border.\n\nSeptember 9, 2015: : India is offering cash rewards of up to $15,000 for information on Naga rebel leaders responsible for a June 4th ambush in the northeast near the Burma border that killed 18 soldiers. This ambush is still big news for most Indians and the reason for the increased activity along the Burmese border.\n\nAugust 22, 2015: In the north (Kachin state) a soldier shot dead a civilian he was arguing with. First the soldier punched the civilian and when the civilian defended himself the soldier opened fire. Other soldiers sought to seize all the cell phones being used to record the incident but the truth got out and now the military has responded by arresting the soldier and promising to prosecute him. Incidents like this are common in the north and the military is under pressure to punish the offenders."], ["http://2ndamendmentfight.com/mass-shootings-are-responsible-for-less-than-100-out-of-12000-annual-homicides-in-the-u-s/", "Mass Shootings Are Responsible For Less than 100 Out of 12,000 Annual Homicides in the U.S.", "Massive media publicity over mass shootings in the last year have brought gun control back to the forefront in the U.S. Banning so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d and \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are all the rage. Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported.

Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number.

However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule.

The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63). This doesn\u2019t mean that it is unlimited, the same as all rights (more on that below). However, the court states that even though gun violence is a problem to be taken seriously, \u201cthe enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table\u201d (p.64).\n\n6. The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this. It\u2019s listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (\u201csecurity of a free state\u201d), then the people need arms: \u201cWhen the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny\u201d (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted \u201cthat history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents\u201d (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: \u201cduring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive\u201d (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens\u2019 militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).\n\n7. The Second Amendment was also meant as a provision to repel a foreign army invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find this one comical, but it\u2019s in there. The court notes one of many reasons for the militia to ensure a free state was \u201cit is useful in repelling invasions\u201d (p.24). This provision, like tyranny, isn\u2019t an everyday occurring use of the right; more like a once-in-a-century (if that) kind of provision. A popular myth from World War II holds Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese navy allegedly said \u201cYou cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\u201d Although there is no evidence of him saying this, there was concern that Japan might invade during WWII. Japan did invade Alaska, which was a U.S. territory at the time, and even today on the West Coast there are still gun embankments from the era (now mostly parks). The fact is that there are over 310 million firearms in the United States as of 2009, making a foreign invasion success less likely (that, and the U.S. military is arguably the strongest in the world).\n\n8. The Second Amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t unlimited: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d (p. 54). The Court upheld restrictions like the prohibition of arms by felons and the mentally ill, and carrying in certain prohibited places like schools and courthouses. What is protected are weapons \u201cin common use of the time\u201d (p.55). This doesn\u2019t mean weapons in common use \u201cat that time,\u201d meaning the 18th Century. The Court said the idea that it would is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\u201d (p.8). The Court\u2019s criteria includes weapons in popular widespread use \u201cthat [are] overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d (p. 56), and \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans\u201d (p. 58).\n\n9. The Second Amendment might require full-blown military arms to fulfill the original intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court didn\u2019t rule specifically on this in D.C. v. Heller, but noting that weapon technology has drastically changed (mentioning modern day bombers and tanks), they stated \u201cthe conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large\u201d (p. 55).\n\nThey further added that \u201cthe fact that modern developments [in modern weaponry] have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right\u201d (p. 56). A full ruling has not been made, as this was not in the scope the court was asked to rule on in the D.C. v. Heller case, but they left the door open for future ruling.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Feb 8, 2013.

City and County Councils have become war zones as citizens question the origins of development plans and planners deny any international connections to the UN\u2019s Agenda 21. What is the truth? Since I helped start this war, I believe it is up to me to help with the answers.\n\nLocal planning is a local idea.The standard points made by those who deny any Agenda 21 connection is that:\n\nAgenda 21 is a non-binding resolution not a treaty, carries no legal authority from which any nation is bound to act. It has no teeth.\n\nThe UN has no enforcement capability.\n\nThere are no \u201cBlue-Helmeted\u201d UN troops at City Hall.\n\nPlanners are simply honest professionals trying to do their job, and all these protests are wasting their valuable time.\n\nThe main concern of Agenda 21 is that man is fouling the environment and using up resources for future generations and we just need a sensible plan to preserve and protect the earth. What is so bad about that?\n\nThere is no hidden agenda.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read Agenda 21 and I can find no threatening language that says it is a global plot. What are you so afraid of?\u201d\n\nAnd of course, the most often heard response \u2013 \u201cAgenda 21, what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nAnd after they have proudly stated these well thought out points, they arrogantly throw down the gauntlet and challenge us to \u201canswer these facts.\u201d\n\nWill one of these \u201cinnocent\u201d promoters of the \u201cAgenda 21 is meaningless\u201d party line, please answer the following: Well, first I have a few questions of my own that I would love to have answered.\n\nIf it all means nothing, why does the UN spend millions of dollars to hold massive international meetings in which hundreds of leaders, potentates and high priests attend, along with thousands of non-governmental organizations of every description, plus the international news media, which reports every action in breathless anticipation of its impact on the world?\n\nIt if all means nothing, why do those same NGO representatives (which are all officially sanctioned by the UN in order to participate) spend months (sometimes years) debating, discussing, compiling, and drafting policy documents?\n\nIf it all means nothing, why do leaders representing nearly every nation in the world attend and, with great fanfare, sign these policy documents?\n\nTime after time we witness these massive international meetings, we read the documents that result from them, and when we question their meaning or possible impact on our nation, we are met with a dismissive shrug and a comment of \u201coh, probably not much\u2026\u201d\n\nReally? Then why? Why the waste of money, time, and human energy? Could it be that the only purpose is to simply give diplomats, bureaucrats, and NGOs a feeling of purpose in their meaningless lives, or perhaps a chance to branch out of their lonely apartments? Or could it really be that these meetings and the documents they produce are exactly as we say they are \u2013 a blueprint for policy, rules, regulations, perhaps even global governance that will affect the lives, fortunes, property and futures of every person on earth? Which is it? You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nWhy the fear of Agenda 21?\n\nThose who simply read or quickly scan Agenda 21 are puzzled by our opposition to what they see as a harmless, non-controversial document which they read as voluntary suggestions for preserving natural resources and protecting the environment. Why the fear? What exactly bothers us so much?\n\nThe problem is, we who oppose Agenda 21 have read and studied much more than this one document and we\u2019ve connected the dots. Many of us have attended those international meetings, rubbed elbows with the authors and leaders of the advocated policies, and overheard their insider (not for public distribution) comments about their real purpose.\n\nHere are a few examples of those comments made by major leaders of this movement as to the true purpose of the policies coming out of these UN meetings:\n\n\u201cNo matter if the science of global warming is all phony\u2026climate change provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.\u201d\n\nChristine Stewart (former Canadian Minister of the Environment)\n\n\u201cThe concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.\u201d Report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\n\u201cRegionalism must precede globalism. We foresee a seamless system of governance from local communities, individual states, regional unions and up through to the United Nations itself.\u201d Report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\nAll three of these quotes (and we have many) indicate using lies and rhetoric to achieve their goals, and that those goals include the elimination of national sovereignty and the creation of a \u201cseamless system\u201d for global governance. Again, do these quotes have meaning and purpose \u2013 do they reveal the true thoughts of the promoters of these policies, or were they just joking?\n\nFor the past three decades through the United Nations infrastructure, there have been a series of meetings, each producing another document or lynchpin to lay the groundwork for a centralized global economy, judicial system, military, and communications system, leading to what can only be described as a global government. From our study of these events, we have come to the conclusion that Agenda 21 represents the culmination of all of those efforts, indeed representing the step by step blueprint for the full imposition of those goals. Here\u2019s just a sample of these meetings and the documents they produced:\n\nIn 1980, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt chaired the Commission on International Development. The document, or report coming out of this effort, entitled \u201cNorth-South: A program for Survival,\u201d stated \u201cWorld development is not merely an economic process, [it] involves a profound transformation of the entire economic and social structure\u2026not only the idea of economic betterment, but also of greater human dignity, security, justice and equality\u2026The Commission realizes that mankind has to develop a concept of a \u2018single community\u2019 to develop global order.\u201d\n\nThat same year Sean MacBride, a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize, headed up a commission on international communications which issued a report entitled \u201cMany Voices, One World: Towards a New, More Just and More Efficient World Information and Communication Order.\u201d The Commission, which included the head of the Soviet news Agency, TASS, believed that a \u201cNew World Information Order\u201d was prerequisite to a new world economic order. The report was a blueprint for controlling the media, even to the point of suggesting that international journalists be licensed.\n\nIn 1982, Olof Palme, the man who single-handedly returned Socialism to Sweden, served as chairman of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues. His report, entitled \u201cCommon Security: A Blueprint for Survival,\u201d said: \u201cAll States have the duty to promote the achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control\u2026\u201d The report went on to call for money that is saved from disarmament to be used to pay for social programs. The Commission also proposed a strategic shift from \u201ccollective security\u201d such as the alliances like NATO, to one of \u201ccommon security\u201d through the United Nations.\n\nFinally, in 1987, came the granddaddy commission of them all, The Brundtland Commission on Environment and Development. Headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Vice President of the World Socialist Party, the commission introduced the concept of \u201cSustainable Development.\u201d For the first time the environment was tied to the tried and true Socialist goals of international redistribution of wealth. Said the report, \u201cPoverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.\u201d\n\nThese four commissions laid the groundwork for an agenda of global control; A controlled media would dictate the flow of information and ideas and prevent dissent; control of international development manages and redistributes wealth; full disarmament would put the power structure into the hands of those with armaments; and tying environmentalism to poverty and economic development would bring the entire agenda to the level of an international emergency.\n\nOne world, one media, one authority for development, one source of wealth, one international army. The construction of a \u201cjust society\u201d with political and social equality rather than a free society with the individual as the sole possessor of rights. The next step was to pull it altogether into a simple blueprint for implementation.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the UN sponsored a series of summits and conferences dealing with such issues as human rights, the rights of the child, forced abortion and sterilization as solutions for population control, and plans for global taxation through the UN.\n\nThroughout each of these summits, hundreds of Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worked behind the scenes to write policy documents pertaining to each of these issues, detailing goals and a process to achieve them. These NGO\u2019s are specifically sanctioned by the United Nations in order to participate in the process. The UN views them as \u201ccivil society, the non governmental representatives of the people. In short, in the eyes of the UN, the NGOs are the \u201cpeople.\u201d\n\nWho are they? They include activist groups with private political agendas including the Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, The Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation, Zero Population Growth, Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, the National Education Association, an d hundreds more. These groups all have specific political agendas which they desire to become law of the land. Through work in these international summits and conferences, their political wish lists become official government policy.\n\nIn fact, through the UN infrastructure the NGOs sit in equality to government officials from member nations including the United States. One of the most powerful UN operations is the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). Created in 1973 by the UN General Assembly, the UNEP is the catalyst through which the global environmental agenda is implemented. Virtually all international environmental programs and policy changes that have occurred globally in the past three decades are a result of UNEP efforts. Sitting in on UNEP meetings, helping to write and implement policy, along with these powerful NGOs are government representatives, including U.S, federal agencies such as the Department of State, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThis, then, is a glimpse of the power structure behind the force that gathered in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 for the UN-sponsored Earth Summit. Here, five major documents, written primarily by NGOs with the guidance and assistance of government agencies, were introduced to the world. In fact, these final documents had been first drafted and honed though the long, arduous series of international conferences previously mentioned. Now, at Rio, they were ready for adoption as a blueprint for what could only be described as the transformation of human society.\n\nThe five documents were: the \u201cConvention on Climate Change,\u201d the precursor to the coming Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, later adopted in 1997; the \u201cBiodiversity Treaty,\u201d which would declare that massive amounts of land should be off limits to human development; the third document was called the \u201cRio Declaration,\u201d which called for the eradication of poverty throughout the world through the redistribution of wealth; the fourth document was the \u201cConvention on Forest Principles,\u201d calling for international management of the world\u2019s forests, essentially shutting down or severely regulating the timber industry; and the fifth document was Agenda 21, which contained the full agenda for implementing worldwide Sustainable Development. The 300 page document contains 40 chapters that address virtually every facet of human life and contains great detail as to how the concept of Sustainable Development should be implemented through every level of government.\n\nWhat did the United Nations believe that process entailed? In 1993, to help explain the far-reaching aspects of the plan, the UN published \u201cAgenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet.\u201d Here\u2019s how the UN described Agenda 21 in that document: \u201cAgenda 21 proposes an array of actions which are intended to be implemented by every person on earth\u2026it calls for specific changes in the activities of all people\u2026Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all humans, unlike anything the world has ever experienced.\u201d I have never read a stronger, more powerful description of the use of government power.\n\nHowever, critics of our efforts against Agenda 21 rush to point out that Agenda 21 is a \u201csoft law\u201d policy \u2013 not a treaty that must be ratified by the U.S. Senate to become law. So it is just a suggestion, nothing to be afraid of. To make such an argument means that these critics have failed to follow the bouncing ball of implementation.\n\nFollowing the bouncing ball to implementation\n\nIt started when, at the Earth Summit, President George H.W. Bush, along with 179 other heads of state signed agreement to Agenda 21. One year later, newly elected President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order # 12852 to create the President\u2019s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD). The Council consisted of 12 cabinet secretaries, top executives from business, and executives from six major environmental organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, The Sierra Club, the World Resources Institute, and the National Wildlife Federation. These were all players in the creation of Agenda 21 at the international level \u2013 now openly serving on the PCSD with the specific mission to implement Agenda 21 into American policy.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the pages of the PCSD report entitled \u201cSustainable America: A new Consensus for the Future, it directly quotes the Brundtland Commission\u2019s report \u201cOur Common Future\u201d for a definition of Sustainable Development. That is about as direct a tie to the UN as one can get. The PCSD brought the concept of Sustainable Development into the policy process of every agencies of the US federal government\n\nA major tool for implementation was the enormous grant-making power of the federal government. Grant programs were created through literally every agency to entice states and local communities to accept Sustainable Development policy in local programs. In fact, the green groups serving on the PCSD, which also wrote Agenda 21 in the first place, knew full well what programs needed to be implemented to enforce Sustainable Development policy, and they helped create the grant programs, complete with specific actions that must be taken by communities to assure the money is properly spent to implement Sustainable Development policy. Those are the \u201cstrings\u201d to which we opponents refer. Such tactics make the grants effective weapons to insure the policy is moving forward.\n\nFrom that point, these same NGOs sent their members into the state legislatures to lobby for and encourage policy and additional state grant programs. They have lobbied for states to produce legislation requiring local communities to implement comprehensive development plans. Once that legislation was in place, the same NGOs (authors of Agenda 21) quickly moved into the local communities to \u201chelp\u201d local governments comply with the state mandates. And they pledged to help by showing communities how to acquire the grant money to pay for it \u2013 with the above mentioned strings attached.\n\nWe\u2019re told over and over again that such policies are local, state and national, with no conspiracy of ties to the UN. Really? Then how are we to explain this message, taken from the Federal Register, August 24, 1998, (Volume 63, Number 163) from a discussion on the EPA Sustainable Development Challenge Grant Program? It says, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Challenge Grant Program is also a step in Implementing \u2018Agenda 21, the Global Plan of Action on Sustainable Development,\u2019 signed by the United Stats at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. All of these programs require broad community participation to identify and address environmental issues.\u201d\n\nOr consider this quote from a report by Phil Janik, Chief Operating Officer of the USDA \u2013 Forest Service, entitled \u201cThe USDA-Forest Service Commitment and Approach to Forest Sustainability\u201d \u201cIn Our Common Future published in 1987, the Brundtland Commission explains that \u2018the environment is where we all live; and development is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode.\u201d In short, Janik was explaining to his audience (the Society of American Foresters) just where the Forest Service was getting its definition of Sustainable Development \u2013 the report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\nMeanwhile, the NGOs began to \u201cpartner\u201d with other governmental organizations like the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Governors Association, the National League of Cities, the National Association of County Administrators and more organizations to which elected representatives belong to, assuring a near that a near universal message of Sustainable Development comes from every level of government.\n\nAnother NGO group which helped write Agenda 21 for the UN Earth Summit was a group originally called the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). It now calls itself ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability. After the Earth Summit in 1992, ICLEI set its mission to move into the policy process of local governments around the world to impose Sustainable Development policy. It now operates in more than 1200 cities globally, including 600 American cities, all of which pay dues for the privilege of working with ICLEI. Like a cancer, ICLEI begins to infest the local government policy, training city employees to think only in terms of Sustainable Development, and replacing local guidelines with international codes, rules and regulations.\n\nSo it\u2019s true, there are no UN blue helmeted troops occupying city halls in America, and yes, the UN itself does not have enforcement capability for this \u201c:non-binding\u201d document called Agenda 21. However, it does have its own storm troopers in the person of the Non-governmental Organizations which the UN officially sanctions to carry on its work. And that is how Agenda 21, a UN policy, has become a direct threat to local American communities.\n\nWhy we oppose Agenda 21\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that we fight Agenda 21 because we oppose its policies and its process, not just its origins. Why do we see it as a threat? Isn\u2019t it just a plan to protect the environment and stop uncontrolled development and sprawl?\n\nAs Henry Lamb of Freedom 21 puts it, \u201cComprehensive land use planning that delivers sustainable development to local communities transforms both the process through which decisions that govern citizens are made, and the market place where citizens must earn their livelihood. The fundamental principle that government is empowered by the consent of the governed is completely by-passed in the process\u2026the natural next step is for government to dictate the behavior of the people who own the land that the government controls.\u201d\n\nTo enforce the policy, local government is being transformed by \u201cstakeholder councils\u201d created and enforced by the same NGO Agenda 21 authors. They are busy creating a matrix of non-elected boards, councils and regional governments that usurp the ability of citizens to have an impact on policy. It\u2019s the demise of representative government. And the councils appear and grow almost overnight.\n\nSustainablists involve themselves in every aspect of society. Here are just a few of the programs and issues that can be found in the Agenda 21 blueprint and can be easily found in nearly every community\u2019s \u201clocal\u201d development plans: Wetlands, conservation easements, water sheds, view sheds, rails \u2013 to- trails, biosphere reserves, greenways, carbon footprints, partnerships, preservation, stakeholders, land use, environmental protection, development, diversity, visioning, open space, heritage areas and comprehensive planning. Every one of these programs leads to more government control, land grabs and restrictions on energy, water, and our own property. When we hear these terms we know that such policy originated on the pages of Agenda 21, regardless of the direct or indirect path it took to get to our community.\n\nYou\u2019ll find Watershed Councils that regulate human action near every trickling stream, river, or lake. Meters are put on wells. Special \u201caction\u201d councils control home size, tree pruning, or removal, even the color you can paint your home or the height of your grass. Historic preservation councils control development in downtown areas, disallowing expansion and new building.\n\nRegional governments are driven by NGOs and stakeholder councils with a few co-opted bureaucrats thrown in to look good. These are run by non-elected councils that don\u2019t answer to the people. In short, elected officials become little more than a rubber stamp to provide official \u201capproval\u201d to the regional bureaucracy.\n\nBut the agenda outlined in Agenda 21 and by its proponents is a much bigger threat that just land use planning. They openly advocate massive reduction of human populations. Some actually call for as much as an 85% reduction in human populations in order to \u201csave the planet.\u201d David Brower of the Sierra Club said, \u201cChildbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license.\u201d The UN\u2019s Biodiversity Assessment says, \u201cA reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present North American material standard of living would be 1 billion.\u201d\n\nThey also openly advocate the destruction of modern society as Maurice Strong, the head of the Earth Summit said, \u201cIsn\u2019t the only hope for the planet that the industrial nations collapse? Isn\u2019t it our responsibility to bring that about?\n\nThis issue then is not about simple environmental protection and modern planning. It is about a complete restructuring of our society, our values and our way of life. They use as their model an urgency based on global warming and climate change, claiming there is no need for discussion on these dire issues. Yet science is showing more and more proof that there is no man-made global warming. Are we to completely destroy our society based on such a shaky foundation?\n\nAnd that is just what the proponents are rushing to do.\n\nBarack Obama has issued a flurry of Executive Orders to bypass the Congressional process and dictate sustainable policy. In 2011 Obama issued EO # 13575 creating the White House Rural Council. It brings together 25 Cabinet Secretaries to enforce multi-jurisdictional enforcement of farming virtually controlling every decision for food production. It is a major assault on American farm production intended to enforce Sustainable farming practices. In truth it will only lead to food shortages and higher prices as farmers have no ability to make a decision without the approval of 25 government agencies, working at cross purposes and causing chaos in farm production.\n\nOn May1, 2012, Obama issued EO # 13609, dictating that the government must enforce coordination of international regulatory policy. Those international regulatory policies are UN-driven and the basic translation means enforcement of Sustainable Development policy.\n\nBut, again, skeptics of our fears of Agenda 21 continue to argue that it is all voluntary and if the US or local governments want to enforce it they are free to do so \u2013 nothing to fear but ourselves. Well, even if that were true, that\u2019s all about to change. On June 15 \u2013 23, international forces are again converging on Rio for Rio+20. The stated intention is to complete the work they began in 1992.\n\nSpecifically called for is a UN treaty on Sustainable Development. If passed by the Senate and signed by the Obama Administration, that will eliminate any ambiguity about where the policy is coming from. Moreover, documents produced so far for the summit call for a global council, new UN agencies, budgets and powers, and \u201cgenuine global actions\u201d in every nation \u2013 to ensure \u201csocial justice,\u201d poverty eradication, climate protection, biodiversity, \u201cgreen growth,\u201d and an end to \u201cunsustainable patterns of consumption.\u201d Again, thousands of NGOs, diplomats and world leaders will spend a lot of money and time in the Rio+20 effort. Is it all just for fun, or does it have a purpose with strong consequences for our way of life?\n\nThe fact is, we fight Agenda 21 because it is all-encompassing, designed to address literally every aspect of our lives. This is so because those promoting Agenda 21 believe we must modify our behavior, our way of doing everyday things, and even our belief system, in order to drastically transform human society into being \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\nWe who oppose it don\u2019t believe that the world is in such dire emergency environmentally that we must destroy the very human civilization that brought us from a life of nothing but survival against the elements into a world that gave us homes, health care, food, and even luxury. Sustainable Development advocates literally hope to roll back our civilization to the days of mere survival and we say NO. Why should we? We have found great deception in the promotion of the global warming argument. We believe in free markets and free societies where people make their own decisions, live and develop their own property. And we fully believe that the true path to a strong protection of the environment is through private property ownership and limited government. Those who promote Agenda 21 do not believe in those ideals. And so we will not agree on the path to the future. And our fight is just that \u2013 a clash of philosophy. There is very little room for middle ground.\n\nThe United States has never been part of a global village in which rules for life have been handed down by some self-appointed village elders. We are a nation of laws that were designed to protect our right to our property and our individual life choices while keeping government reined in. We oppose Agenda 21 precisely because it represents the exact opposite view of government.\n\nPART 2\n\nAGENDA 21 CONSPIRACY THEORY OR THREAT\n\nPART 2 of 2\n\nby Tom DeWeese\n\nMay 21, 2012\n\nNewsWithViews.com\n\nThe five documents were: the \u201cConvention on Climate Change,\u201d the precursor to the coming Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, later adopted in 1997; the \u201cBiodiversity Treaty,\u201d which would declare that massive amounts of land should be off limits to human development; the third document was called the \u201cRio Declaration,\u201d which called for the eradication of poverty throughout the world through the redistribution of wealth; the fourth document was the \u201cConvention on Forest Principles,\u201d calling for international management of the world\u2019s forests, essentially shutting down or severely regulating the timber industry; and the fifth document was Agenda 21, which contained the full agenda for implementing worldwide Sustainable Development.

In 1993, to help explain the far-reaching aspects of the plan, the UN published \u201cAgenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet.\u201d Here\u2019s how the UN described Agenda 21 in that document: \u201cAgenda 21 proposes an array of actions which are intended to be implemented by every person on earth\u2026it calls for specific changes in the activities of all people\u2026Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all humans, unlike anything the world has ever experienced.\u201d I have never read a stronger, more powerful description of the use of government power.\n\nHowever, critics of our efforts against Agenda 21 rush to point out that Agenda 21 is a \u201csoft law\u201d policy \u2013 not a treaty that must be ratified by the U.S. Senate to become law. So it is just a suggestion, nothing to be afraid of. To make such an argument means that these critics have failed to follow the bouncing ball of implementation.\n\nFollowing the bouncing ball to implementation\n\nREAD MORE HERE:"], ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-obamas-dishonest-presidency/2013/11/04/841947c6-4561-11e3-b6f8-3782ff6cb769_story.html", "Marc Thiessen: Obama\u2019s dishonest presidency", "The Wall Street Journal broke the news this weekend that, even as President Obama was telling the American people they could keep their health plans, \u201csome White House policy advisors objected to the breadth of Mr. Obama\u2019s \u2018keep your plan\u2019 promise.

Every draft address is circulated to the White House senior staff and key Cabinet officials in something called the \u201cstaffing process.\u201d Every line is reviewed by dozens of senior officials, who offer comments and factual corrections. During this process, it turns out, some of Obama\u2019s policy advisers objected to the \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d pledge, pointing out that it was untrue. But it stayed in the speech. That does not happen by accident. It requires a willful intent to deceive.\n\nIn the Bush White House, we speechwriters would often come up with what we thought were great turns of phrase to help the president explain his policies. But we also had a strict fact-checking process, where every iteration of every proposed presidential utterance was scrubbed to ensure it was both accurate and defensible. If the fact-checkers told us a line was inaccurate, we would either kill it or find another way to make the point accurately. I cannot imagine a scenario in which the fact-checkers or White House policy advisers would tell us that something in a draft speech was factually incorrect and that guidance would be ignored or overruled by the president\u2019s political advisers.\n\nThis whole episode is a window into a fundamentally dishonest presidency. And the story gets worse. After Obama began telling Americans they could keep their plans, White House aides discussed using media interviews \u201cto explain the nuances of the succinct line in his stump speeches.\u201d But they decided not to do so, because \u201cofficials worried . . . that delving into details such as the small number of people who might lose insurance could be confusing and would clutter the president\u2019s message.\u201d\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

Gee, thanks.\u201d) That would certainly have been less powerful, but at least it would have been accurate.\n\nBut Obama didn\u2019t say those things. He said, \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health-care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.\u201d That statement was clear, unequivocal and wrong \u2014 and Obama and his advisers knew it.\n\nThe president\u2019s defenders are twisting around for ways to explain away his 16 words.

It was a line in a presidential speech that was carefully reviewed by the entire White House senior staff. Obama\u2019s political advisers were told by his policy aides the statement was inaccurate \u2014 but they decided to let Americans believe the falsehood.\n\nObama\u2019s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, told the Journal that the speechwriters were working to find ways to explain a complex policy and that the goal was \u201csimplification and ease of explanation . . . while still being true.\u201d Except what Obama said wasn\u2019t true.\n\nEvery president faces the challenge of explaining complex policies in simple terms.

That measure, known as the Waxman-Markey bill, passed the House but was defeated in the Senate at a time when Democrats controlled both houses.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s plan comes after years of criticism from environmentalists who have faulted him for a lack of attention to global warming. The plan includes reducing carbon pollution from power plants, accelerating green-energy permitting, and increasing fuel-economy standards.\n\nMs. McCarthy said Colorado and Boulder are examples of jurisdictions that have taken positive action.\n\n\u201c[The president] told us to start paying attention to what\u2019s going on in states and cities like Colorado and Boulder, and to start learning what you have already learned and to start getting the federal government to take the responsibility that it must take to face the challenge of climate change,\u201d she said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t list specific actions, but in June the Boulder City Council voted to enact a one-year moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, a procedure used to extract petroleum and natural gas from the ground.\n\nThe Colorado legislature passed a bill earlier this year to double the renewable-energy standard on rural communities, prompting a backlash against what critics have dubbed \u201cthe war on rural Colorado\u201d and launching a movement by lawmakers in a dozen northern counties to explore forming their own state.\n\nMs. McCarthy\u2019s remarks came prior to a panel discussion featuring former Colorado Gov.

And many are anxious to see how the popular pope will tailor his message to them.\n\n\"Catholicism in America today is a more diverse population,\" said William Dinges, a professor of religious studies at Catholic University. That trend, he said, covers not only who American Catholics are, but what they believe, and how they view themselves in relation to the church.\n\nConsider this portrait sketched out by the Pew Research Center, based on recent surveys:\n\nA growing proportion of American Catholics \u2014 34 percent, up from 29 percent in 2007 \u2014 are Hispanic, and more than a quarter were born outside of the United States.\n\nHalf of those who said they were raised Catholic have left the church. Of that group, 41 percent never returned, though many of them have become \"cultural Catholics\" who still identify with the religion in some way.\n\nOne in four have gone through a divorce, and four in 10 said they'd lived with a romantic partner at some point in their lives. Six in 10 said Catholics who are cohabitating or had been divorced and remarried without getting an annulment should be able to receive communion.\n\nTwo-thirds of Catholics said it was acceptable for same-sex couples to raise children. Forty-three percent said a gay or lesbian couple raising children was as good as any other kind of family. And 46 percent said the church should recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nAsked whether homosexual behavior was a sin, 39 said no, and 44 percent said yes.\n\n\"Overall, Catholics look a lot like the general public on these questions,\" said Jessica Martinez, a senior researcher at Pew. \"The church has traditionally frowned on things like cohabitation and children being raised by gay parents. But, like many U.S. adults, more U.S. Catholics have experienced things like divorce and living with a non-married partner, or know someone who has.\"\n\nPew also touched upon another thorny issue for the American church: the size of its membership. The pollsters estimated that there were about 51 million Catholic adults in the United States in 2014, or about 20.8 percent of the population \u2014 down about 3 million people from its 2007 survey.\n\nThat drop, Pew said, reflects a widening gap between the number of people who have left the church and the number of those who join or return \u2014 and a surge in the number of young Americans who claim no religious affiliation at all.\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed 0:45 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nOther polls have not recorded a decrease. Gallup and the Public Religion Research Institute, for instance, have the proportion of Catholics among the U.S. population remaining relatively steady.\n\nMark Gray, a senior research associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, said he was puzzled by that aspect of Pew's findings.\n\n\"We see no decline in the Catholic population,\" he said.\n\nGray said he has noticed declines in the Northeast and Midwest, but they have been offset by growth in the South and West. \"It's simple demographics \u2014 migration, immigration, places where America is growing in general,\" he said.\n\nImmigration has always been pivotal to the growth American Catholicism; before the influx of those from Latin America, its ranks swelled with Catholics from Europe.\n\nThe most recent wave of Hispanic immigrants is propping up the U.S. Catholic population, Dinges said. Without them, there'd be a pronounced decline, he said.\n\nSix out of 10 American Catholics told Gallup this year that the country should give undocumented immigrants a way to become citizens. On that issue, they appear to be on common ground with Francis, who has urged compassion for the world's immigrants, including those who enter the United States illegally.\n\nAmerican Catholics' evolution on family and social issues \u2014 divorce, same-sex marriage \u2014 goes far beyond the church's formal positions, but that gap may be narrowing. The Pope has expressed views that appear to indicate an openness to revised doctrine.\n\nThere is less apparent agreement on the environment, another of Francis' signature issues.\n\nEarlier this year, the Pope Francis issued a statement, or encyclical, blaming humans for global warming, linking the destruction to rampant materialism, and calling for radical reform.\n\nPew's latest survey of American Catholics took place few weeks before that statement was made public. But the responses are telling: just 23 percent said it was a sin to use energy without considering the environment, and less than a third said working to address climate change was essential to what being Catholic meant to them.\n\nThose differences aside, Francis remains widely popular among American Catholics: Pew found earlier this year that 86 percent had a favorable view of him.\n\nThat enthusiastic following echoes around the world, and has spawned a concept called \"The Francis Effect\" \u2014 the pope's potential for drawing more people to the church, reframing decades-old culture-war battles, even influencing elections.\n\nBut that's all speculation.

The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63). This doesn\u2019t mean that it is unlimited, the same as all rights (more on that below). However, the court states that even though gun violence is a problem to be taken seriously, \u201cthe enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table\u201d (p.64).\n\n6. The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this. It\u2019s listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (\u201csecurity of a free state\u201d), then the people need arms: \u201cWhen the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny\u201d (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted \u201cthat history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents\u201d (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: \u201cduring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive\u201d (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens\u2019 militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).\n\n7. The Second Amendment was also meant as a provision to repel a foreign army invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find this one comical, but it\u2019s in there. The court notes one of many reasons for the militia to ensure a free state was \u201cit is useful in repelling invasions\u201d (p.24). This provision, like tyranny, isn\u2019t an everyday occurring use of the right; more like a once-in-a-century (if that) kind of provision. A popular myth from World War II holds Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese navy allegedly said \u201cYou cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\u201d Although there is no evidence of him saying this, there was concern that Japan might invade during WWII. Japan did invade Alaska, which was a U.S. territory at the time, and even today on the West Coast there are still gun embankments from the era (now mostly parks). The fact is that there are over 310 million firearms in the United States as of 2009, making a foreign invasion success less likely (that, and the U.S. military is arguably the strongest in the world).\n\n8. The Second Amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t unlimited: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d (p. 54). The Court upheld restrictions like the prohibition of arms by felons and the mentally ill, and carrying in certain prohibited places like schools and courthouses. What is protected are weapons \u201cin common use of the time\u201d (p.55). This doesn\u2019t mean weapons in common use \u201cat that time,\u201d meaning the 18th Century. The Court said the idea that it would is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\u201d (p.8). The Court\u2019s criteria includes weapons in popular widespread use \u201cthat [are] overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d (p. 56), and \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans\u201d (p. 58).\n\n9. The Second Amendment might require full-blown military arms to fulfill the original intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court didn\u2019t rule specifically on this in D.C. v. Heller, but noting that weapon technology has drastically changed (mentioning modern day bombers and tanks), they stated \u201cthe conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large\u201d (p. 55).\n\nThey further added that \u201cthe fact that modern developments [in modern weaponry] have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right\u201d (p. 56). A full ruling has not been made, as this was not in the scope the court was asked to rule on in the D.C. v. Heller case, but they left the door open for future ruling.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Feb 8, 2013.

The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63).

On Thursday, an article at Artvoice said the clock was not homemade, but was instead a previously-manufactured device that was disassembled and put back together in a pencil case.\n\nThe author of the post originally said the clock was a 1970s vintage model built by Micronta, a Radio Shack subsidiary. A reader, however, corrected the author, saying it was a model sold by Radio Shack in 1986.\n\n\u201cAnthony,\u201d the author of the Artvoice piece, professed to have an engineering degree and simply wanted to know what it was Mohamed had created. After analyzing photos and video of the device, he concluded that the 14-year-old did not invent anything. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even build a clock,\u201d Anthony said.\n\n\u201cFor starters, one glance at the printed circuit board in the photo, and I knew we were looking at mid-to-late 1970s vintage electronics,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice right away the highly accurate spacing, straightness of the lines, consistency of the patterns,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s because we design things on computers nowadays, and computers assist in routing these lines.\u201d\n\nAfter observing the traces on Mohamed\u2019s circuit board, Anthony noted the \u201cM\u201d logo silk-screened on the board, along with \u201cC-94,\u201d which he suspected was a part number along with an American flag. \u201cPoint for now being, a hobbyist wouldn\u2019t silk screen logos and part numbers on their home made creation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty safe to say already we\u2019re looking at \u201970s tech, mass produced in a factory.\u201d\n\nArmed with that information, Anthony said it only took \u201ca minute\u201d to find Ahmed\u2019s clock on eBay. The large display along with the shape and design was a dead giveaway, he added. The \u201cM\u201d logo, he added, indicated that it was made by Micronta.\n\nHe also located the pencil box Mohamed used for his project on Amazon. The eBay seller, he added, took a photo of the clock next to a ruler and found the dimensions lined up \u201cperfectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there you have it folks,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cAhmed Mohamed did not invent, nor build a clock. He took apart an existing clock, and transplanted the guts into a pencil box, and claimed it was his own creation. It all seems really fishy to me.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a video that explains more:\n\nOthers found a number of things \u201cfishy\u201d with the whole Mohamed clock story. A post at Young Conservatives, for example, said Mohamed\u2019s father, also named Mohamed, ran for president in Sudan twice from his Texas home and stood up to the Florida pastor who made news when he burned Korans.\n\nThe younger Mohamed also said he was concerned that the device would \u201clook suspicious\u201d to some. Our own Faye Higbee wondered why he would bring the device to school if he thought it would raise suspicions.\n\nIf the intent was to raise the specter of perceived \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d it worked. As many have noted, the story has gone viral on social media and President Barack Obama has invited the young man to the White House to show off his work, which he admitted was thrown together in about 20 minutes.\n\nCool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great. \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015\n\nAccording to Breitbart\u2019s Merrill Hope, officers questioning the young man described him as \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d in his responses, and, they added, he did not have a \u201creasonable answer\u201d to explain the situation. \u201cHe kept maintaining it was a clock,\u201d Irving police officer James McLellan said, \u201cbut there was no broader explanation.\u201d\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) got involved, calling the incident an example of Islamophobia, and the local chapter president claimed Mohamed was targeted only because of his race and religious background. Officers, no doubt concerned about such allegations, did not know how they should respond to the situation.\n\n\u201cIt could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car,\u201d McLellan said. \u201cThe concern was, what was this thing built for? Do we take him into custody?\u201d\n\nMohamed was not taken into custody, but the school suspended him for three days and confiscated the clock. Authorities may still charge him with making a bomb hoax, but were clear the device was not a bomb. According to Anthony, it also wasn\u2019t a clock.\n\nRelated:\n\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."], ["http://benybs.blogspot.com/2015/02/obama-refuses-to-acknowledge-muslim.html", "#obama refuses to acknowledge #Muslim terrorists at summit #pjnet #ccot #tcot #NewYorkPost", "A Leader envisions an end-state, motivates, plans & coordinates the judicious use of resources (onto a timeline) that influence a desired (course of) action & maintains flow until a desired standard is achieved or diminishing returns realized.

In reality this entire hoopla was not sprung up by native Americans, but a VERY small group of \u201cprogressives\u201d who apparently split from their comrades who busy themselves protesting the pledge of allegiance, nativity displays and the like.\n\nDignitas News was able to infiltrate a high level meeting of the Progressive PC Police team, as they discussed the ongoing dispute over the Washington Redskins team mascot and branding. The following are excerpts from their strategy meeting:\n\nNE Patriots-On top of being potentially anti-British, it harkens to our militaristic past. How about the New England Global Villagers?\n\nNY Jets-Commercial air transit has been one of the engines of the capitalist machine. Besides, Manhattan (thats all that really counts in NY anyway, right) should have a team with a more soccer-ish sounding name, which should be the sport we like anyway, if America wasnt so\u2026.like\u2026American! How bout the NY Style?\n\nMiami Dolphins-Dolphins get stuck in the nets meant for tuna. Meat is murder. Lets just call them the Miami Heat like the basketball team. It will make it easier when we re-organize the major cities into communal camps.\n\nBuffalo Bills-I know we cant do anything about the city name (yet) but somehow it just feels anti-Indian. After all, Bison (which is more proper, or Ta Ton Ka) was a noble staple of the native American diet, unlike the \u201csettlers\u201d who probably killed them for pleasure, gluttony and the NRA. How about the Buffalo Springfield? I just love \u201cWhats that sound.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh Steelers-I know its in reference to the steel-men (Im sorry steel PERSONS) who worked the mills, but not only did men get rich off of steel, it just sounds like \u201csteal,\u201d And since their colors are black, we dont want to imply that black people steal things. Let\u2019s honor the them by calling them Pittsburgh Unionists.\n\nCleveland Browns-Seriously? OMG. I mean, brown-pride is beautiful but lets not go there. How about Cleveland Undocumented Citizens. No, that\u2019s too long, the Cleveland Dreamers.\n\nHouston Texans-Where does one begin? Oh well, I cant think of one, but go Wendy Davis!!\n\nTennessee Titans-\u201cTitans\u201d reminds me too much of the 1%. Lets flip the switch and call them the Occupiers. Or simply, Occupy Tennessee.\n\nKC Chiefs-Oh goodness!! Not only is this offensive to native Americans (even if it isnt, lets just say it is) it also demeans the notion of the village, as we should all be equal, after all. Commissars is better, I think.\n\nSD Chargers-Instead of honoring for-profit polluters, lets go with the San Diego Renewable Energy\u2026or even better, the San Diego Solars!!\n\nOakland Raiders-This used to be okay, because our average idea of a pirate was always being white. That\u2019s not the case anymore, so we should reconsider. How about the Oakland Income Re-distributors?\n\nSF 49\u2019ers-Why celebrate the greedy gold rush? Let\u2019s reflect the city\u2019s diversity: San Francisco LGBT\u2019ers!\n\nGB Packers-While some smart aleck suggested we just re-shuffle their name to San Fran, I\u2019m okay with the name, but we should add \u201cLocal 437\u201d to it.\n\nMinnesota Vikings-This one was a bit confusing. Although some comrades argued that it displays people of Norwegian decent as violent and barbaric, I figured it was okay because they, but I was reminded we should be consistent, so, in honor of his naming the first woman VP candidate the group voted for the Minnesota Mondales! Forward!\n\nDallas Cowboys-The name in itself is sexist and offensive. Cowperson\u2019s will do just fine.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles-We have pretty much given animal names a pass (with notable exceptions) but \u201cEagles\u201d are too often used as a symbol of national pride. Especially by those tea-baggers. We all love Elton John, so we are going with the Philadelphia Freedom! Hmm, that could be counter intuitive as well\u2026hmmmm, thats it! The Spotted Owls!!\n\nNY Giants-Derogatory names are hurtful and a form of bullying. The New York People of Extraordinary Height!\n\nNew Orleans Saints-You didn\u2019t honestly think we would let this one pass? We have a separation of church and state in this country. And pretty much anything else, if we scream loud enough. Besides, we need reasons to remember our hatred of Bush. The New Orleans Katrina Victims.\n\nTB Buccaneers-See Oakland for notes. The Tampa Gay\u2019s. Just because it fits.\n\nAs for the Redskins themselves (eww\u2026I just feel dirty even saying it), we are a bit split, but thus far the two leading candidates would be the \u201cDeadskins\u201d or the Washington Casino Owning-Americans.\n\nAs stated, animal named teams are exempt for now, but debate continues.

That measure, known as the Waxman-Markey bill, passed the House but was defeated in the Senate at a time when Democrats controlled both houses.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s plan comes after years of criticism from environmentalists who have faulted him for a lack of attention to global warming. The plan includes reducing carbon pollution from power plants, accelerating green-energy permitting, and increasing fuel-economy standards.\n\nMs. McCarthy said Colorado and Boulder are examples of jurisdictions that have taken positive action.\n\n\u201c[The president] told us to start paying attention to what\u2019s going on in states and cities like Colorado and Boulder, and to start learning what you have already learned and to start getting the federal government to take the responsibility that it must take to face the challenge of climate change,\u201d she said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t list specific actions, but in June the Boulder City Council voted to enact a one-year moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, a procedure used to extract petroleum and natural gas from the ground.\n\nThe Colorado legislature passed a bill earlier this year to double the renewable-energy standard on rural communities, prompting a backlash against what critics have dubbed \u201cthe war on rural Colorado\u201d and launching a movement by lawmakers in a dozen northern counties to explore forming their own state.\n\nMs. McCarthy\u2019s remarks came prior to a panel discussion featuring former Colorado Gov.

A government that fails to care for our men and women on the frontlines is guilty of malpractice. A government that puts the needs of illegal aliens above U.S. veterans for political gain should be prosecuted for criminal neglect bordering on treason.\n\nCompare, contrast and weep:\n\nIn Sacramento, Calif., lawmakers are moving forward with a budget-busting plan to extend government-funded health insurance to at least 1.5 million illegal aliens.\n\nIn Los Angeles, federal bureaucrats callously canceled an estimated 40,000 diagnostic tests and treatments for American veterans with cancer and other illnesses to cover up a decade-long backlog.\n\nIn New York, doctors report that nearly 40 percent of their patients receiving kidney dialysis are illegal aliens. A survey of nephrologists in 44 states revealed that 65 percent of them treat illegal aliens with kidney disease.\n\nIn Memphis, a VA whistleblower reported that his hospital was using contaminated kidney dialysis machines to treat America's warriors. The same hospital previously had been investigated for chronic overcrowding at its emergency room, leading to six-hour waits or longer. Another watchdog probe found unconscionable delays in processing lab tests at the center. In addition, three patients died under negligent circumstances, and the hospital failed to enforce accountability measures.\n\nIn Arizona, illegal aliens incurred health care costs totaling an estimated $700 million in 2009.\n\nIn Phoenix, at least 40 veterans died waiting for VA hospitals and clinics to treat them, while government officials created secret waiting lists to cook the books and deceive the public about deadly treatment delays.\n\nAt the University of California at Berkeley, UC President Janet Napolitano (former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security) has offered $5 million in financial aid to illegal alien students. Across the country, 16 states offer in-state tuition discounts for illegal aliens: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington. In addition, the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and the University of Michigan Board of Regents all approved their own illegal alien tuition benefits.\n\nIn 2013, the nation's most selective colleges and universities had enrolled just 168 American veterans, down from 232 in 2011. Anti-war activists have waged war on military recruitment offices at elite campuses for years. The huge influx of illegal aliens in state universities is shrinking the number of state-subsidized slots for vets.\n\nIn 2013, the Obama Department of Homeland Security released 36,007 known, convicted criminal illegal aliens, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. The catch-and-release beneficiaries include thugs convicted of homicide, sexual assault, kidnapping, and thousands of drunk or drugged driving crimes.\n\nThe same Department of Homeland Security issued a report in 2009 that identified returning combat veterans as worrisome terrorist and criminal threats to America.\n\nIn Washington, Big Business and open-borders lobbyists are redoubling efforts to pass another massive illegal alien amnesty to flood the U.S. job market with low-wage labor.\n\nAcross the country, men and women in uniform returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan have higher jobless rates than the civilian population.

Shame on us."], ["http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/12/convention-states-good-bad/", "Convention of the States \u2013 Good or Bad?", "Have you heard about the gathering of state legislators at Mount Vernon to discuss a Convention of States? Well, in case you've missed it, one hundred legislators from 32 states gathered at the home of George Washington on Saturday to discuss, of all things, the possibility of a Convention of the States to propose amendments to the Constitution, as described in Article V of the US Constitution.\n\nWhile many Americans may hoot and holler about such an event saying that it is needed to curb this out of control government and administration, let us play devil's advocate for just one minute to look at this with a more than skeptical eye. These supposedly well-meaning state legislators are meeting to discuss a Convention of the States for the purpose of securing amendments to the Constitution for Congressional term limits and a balanced budget. They recognize the low approval rating for all branches of government, the rampant corruption in Washington, DC, out of control entitlement programs and a complicated tax code that is literally strangling this country to death. Also being discussed is an amendment that would limit federal taxation and spending. While standing in Mount Vernon, this group of state legislators \"emphasized a bipartisan purpose for a future convention.\"\n\nThere is that word \"bipartisan\" again. Democrats and Republicans are nothing more than different sides of the same coin. One is heads and one is tails; which one is the tail changes periodically but it can be said that both are basically the horse's a**. These legislators lit up the Twitter and posed for photos smiling as though they have tapped into a power whereby their intervention will save the people from this runaway government and criminal president. Well, let me just say when I hear the word \"bipartisan,\" I get ready to bend over because it inevitably follows that somehow the American public is going to be shafted.\n\nThe last amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1992 to become the 27th amendment. It states, \"No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of the Representatives shall have intervened.\"\n\nNow, I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but this does not sound to me like it limits in anyway a Congressional pay increase, nor does it limit Congress from doing anything except making a law until the elected Representatives have proposed it since the House of Representatives control the purse. There is no limit applied to any compensation for their services. This is nothing more than Washington double speak to increase their pay whenever they see fit after the duly elected Representatives vote on it. Congress are the only employees I know that can subsequently give themselves a raise and tell their employer it has to be paid. If any additional amendments to the Constitution are like this one, well, there are no words to describe the disgust.\n\nOur current government is operating so far outside the Constitution, ignoring basic tenets of the Constitution regarding presidential eligibility, enumerated powers, and restrictions placed on it, that another amendment is just more words for them to ignore. So pardon me if I don't jump up and down, singing \"God Bless America,\" when faced with a group of state politicians grandstanding to garner support for a Convention of the States to propose a \"supposed\" restriction on a federal government that isn't going to follow it anyway.\n\nLet's be totally honest here. What politician, and these are politicians just at the state level, truly has the best interest of their constituents at heart? If there is one, I want to meet them. They are more than welcome to contact me through Freedom Outpost because I truly want to have a conversation with them, if they are brave enough to face an ordinary American citizen and be asked the tough questions regarding the elephants in the room I am tired of stepping around. If they truly are interested in the best interest of Americans, let's hear them talk about upholding the Constitution; let's hear them go against the platform of their \"party\" to talk common sense and exhibit statesmanship, instead of spouting the talk of a good game \u2013 let's see them live it through actions. I won't hold my breath because I'll pass out first.\n\nI don't see this as an opportunity to regain the government that is supposed to be \"by the people, of the people and for the people.\" I see this as an opportunity by state legislators of certain states to gain support for their agenda which may not be far off from the federal government. If term limits for Congress ever become law, this just means that more state legislators, politicians if you will, get an opportunity to exact their agenda on the people through the federal mechanism. It will be more of the same, with different players, more frequently. They will have garnered the support of the public through the ruse of the Con-Con.\n\nStates are still sovereign. State governments can still use nullification. States can exercise their rights. They don't because they have become dependent on entitlements from the federal government. The legislators in the states have betrayed their oaths by refusing to uphold state sovereignty but want the American people to applaud them for their \"move\" to call a Convention of the States. These elected state officials are telling the American people they want amendments to limit Congressional terms, balance a budget and limit taxation and spending at the federal level.\n\nLooking at the 27th Amendment, I can just imagine the \"limits\" those amendments would have along with plenty of pork that you could host a nationwide barbecue for a year.\n\nIt boils down to one thing and one thing only; there is no way to legislate values and principles. Yes, the Constitution provides a remedy for our current situation in Article V; however, every tenet of government is so corrupted with the atmosphere of \"the flavor of the month\" causes that the risk of further damage outweighs the benefit until the people reclaim their local and state governments, then work up to the federal level. That is, if we can at this point. Democrat party die-hard supporting Americans will vote for a Democrat if a peanut ran for office while Republican Party die-hard supporting Americans will vote for a dollar bill if it ran.\n\nThere is no magic wand or \"gathering\" of state legislators that can alter the course of this country. Only the people can do that through concerted effort. Ask yourself this one question: Do you trust a politician?\n\nDon't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook, Google Plus, & Twitter.

As with Bishop Sorondo, some critics simply fail to see the goals of the United Nations as dangerous or the end result of a Communist agenda, and many attempt to put a Catholic spin on the Sustainable Development Goals, trying to interpret them in terms of Catholic teaching. In one interview, Bishop Sorondo actually attempted to place a Catholic understanding on the term \u201creproductive health\u201d as it is identified in the Sustainable Development Goals:\n\nUndoubtedly, you discussed Ban Ki-moon\u2019s and Jeffrey Sachs\u2019 position on abortion and population control in the lead up to the conference. How were any questions resolved?\n\nS.S. Yes. We had these discussions, and as you can see, the draft SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) don\u2019t even mention abortion or population control . They speak of access to family planning and sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. The interpretation and application of these depends on governments. Some may even interpret it as Paul VI, in terms of responsible paternity and maternity. Instead of attacking us, why not enter into dialogue with these \u201cdemons\u201d to maybe make the formulation better, like we did on the issues of social inclusion and new forms of slavery?\n\nWhile the Sustainable Development Goals do not include the words \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cpopulation control,\u201d it is rather intellectually dishonest to assert that the UN\u2019s use of the terms \u201cfamily planning and sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights\u201d do not carry with them the intention to spread abortion and birth control. Even the SDGs themselves identify the definition of these terms. As indicated in our previous report on the abortion and contraception spreading aspect of the SDGs, the SDGs call for:\n\n\u201cuniversal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action.\u201d\n\nIn our report, we identified in which ways family planning, reproductive health and reproductive rights were agreed upon in the Programme of Action of the ICPD and the Beijing Platform for Action. In short, both documents indicate these terms mean the full range of contraception, including abortifacients, and the use of abortion except as a means of family planning. Even if, as Bishop Sorondo indicates, some countries may interpret these terms in line with the teaching of Pope Paul VI, the agencies of the United Nations, such as the UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and others who will be implementing the SDGs throughout the world will be doing so according to their use of these terms. And since these agencies push contraception and abortion, we can be certain that they will be doing so with the roll-out of the Sustainable Development Goals as well.\n\nSo, while it is possible to interpret the Sustainable Development Goals with a Catholic understanding, it is na\u00efve to assert that the United Nations intend these goals to be understood in line with Catholic teaching. As our previous report on this topic addressed the distinct mark of Communism contained in the Sustainable Development Goals, it is necessary to see how the forces guiding the United Nations from the very beginning have been deeply rooted in Communist ideologies. Let\u2019s not forget that the 11th goal of Communism identified by Cleon Skousen in his book The Naked Communist is, \u201cPromote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces.\u201d Aside from the part about an armed force, the Sustainable Development Goals do exactly this; create panic over an alleged pending ecological disaster, establish the UN as the only hope for mankind in resolving this problem, and if implemented, establishes the UN as a supranational entity that functions as a force for global governance. This will not be an exhaustive review of the Communist nature of the UN, but should provide enough information to show that the Sustainable Development Goals, properly understood, must be taken in line with the aims of Communism and cannot be interpreted with a Catholic understanding.\n\nThe Founding of the United Nations\n\nThe United Nations was founded on April 25, 1945 following months of planning and negotiations conducted through an international conference held in Washington, DC called the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. The executive director for this conference, and subsequently the secretary-general for the United Nations Charter Conference and the temporary first secretary-general of the United Nations itself was a man named Alger Hiss. In 1948, Hiss was accused of being a Communist and subsequently convicted in 1950. And though Hiss denied ever being a Communist, even to the day of his death in 1996, Hiss was identified by former KGB officer Alexander Vassiliev as a Communist spy in 2009. That Hiss was a Communist is important to establish because it was through Hiss\u2019s diplomatic insistence that the Soviet Union received three votes in the United Nations, while the United States received only one. Furthermore, it should be noted that Hiss\u2019s appointment as the temporary secretary-general of the United Nations was personally recommended by the Soviet UN ambassador.\n\nAs an interesting point of fact, while not conclusive in and of itself, it\u2019s worth noting that the emblem of the United Nations was designed under Hiss\u2019s direction and bears a striking resemblance to the State Emblem of the Soviet Union.\n\nHiss did not remain with the United Nations for long, but the influence of Communist leadership at the United Nations did. Following Hiss, every single secretary-general of the United Nations has been a socialist, which is merely a less militant brand of Communism.\n\nWhat follows is a list of every secretary-general following Alger Hiss with brief biographical information illustrating that each is a socialist or at least works toward socialist ends.\n\nTrygve Halvdan Lie (1946\u20131953) \u2013 Lie was a member of the Norwegian Labour Party, which is a full member of the Party of European Socialists. According to a 25 November 1946 article in Time Magazine titled, \u201cImmigrant to What?\u201d Lie was a life-long socialist who actually met Vladimir Lenin in Moscow while on business for the Labour Party.\n\nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld (1953\u20131961) \u2013 Even though Hammarskj\u00f6ld never joined any political party, he was instrumental in shaping the socialist economic policies of Sweden prior to becoming secretary-general of the United Nations.\n\nU Thant (1962\u20131971) \u2013 According to a 1961 article in Time Magazine titled, \u201cNeutralist with Moral Fiber,\u201d U Thant called himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d He also called birth control a \u201cbasic human right and an indispensable ingredient of human dignity.\u201d\n\nKurt Waldheim (1972\u20131981) \u2013 Waldheim was a voluntary member of the National Socialist German Students\u2019 League, a division of the Nazi Party. He was also a registered member of the elite Nazi Storm Troops called the SA.\n\nJavier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (1982\u20131991) \u2013 Upon assuming his position as head of the United Nations, Cuellar called for a radical global redistribution of wealth (a socialist goal). While in office, he warned about so-called \u201coverpopulation,\u201d and personally provided checks for $10,000 and gold medals to \u201cindividuals or institutions making outstanding contributions to family planning.\u201d\n\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali (1992\u20131996) \u2013 From 1974 to 1977, he was a member of the Central Committee and Political Bureau of the Arab Socialist Union. He was also Vice-President of the Socialist International. The Socialist International, also known as the Second International, was founded by Marx and Engels.\n\nKofi Annan (1997\u20132006) \u2013 Kofi Annan endorsed a redistribution of wealth, calling on Western nations to dine on insects for the sake of the environment. Calling reproductive health \u201cone of the key tools in the wider battle against poverty,\u201d Annan said, \u201dPopulation stabilization should become a priority for sustainable development, including a strong focus on the empowerment of women and girls.\u201d Annan also promotes human cloning, abortion, abortifacient contraception, and same-sex \u201cmarriage.\u201d The Millennium Development Goals (the precursor of the Sustainable Development Goals) were launched under Annan\u2019s leadership, and Annan appointed Jeffrey Sachs as the architect of the MDGs.\n\nBan Ki-Moon (2007-present) \u2013 Ban Ki Moon has pushed for universal access to abortion and birth control for teens. Moon has also given full support for same-sex \u201cmarriage.\u201d Moon has also pushed for a global tax which would reshape the world economy in favor of a socialist model.\n\nIn addition to the Secretary-Generals of the United Nations having been made up of socialists and population-control advocates, nearly every single agency of the United Nations is geared toward spreading contraception as a means of population control. What follows are brief summaries about some of the UN agencies as described by the UN itself, and the ways in which they are attacking human sexuality. Our analysis is in red.\n\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \u2013 the UN\u2019s global development network, focusing on the challenges of democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery, energy and environment, and HIV/AIDS. UNDP also coordinates national and international efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals aimed at poverty reduction. The UNDP is also thoroughly committed to spreading all forms of contraception, including abortifacients and sterilization.\n\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF ) \u2013 provides long-term humanitarian and development assistance to children and mothers. UNICEF promotes all forms of contraception, supports homosexuality, and teaches kids that abstinence means \u201ckissing, cuddling, massaging and mutual masturbation.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) \u2013 protects refugees worldwide and facilitates their return home or resettlement. Promotes abortifacient emergency contraception and IUDs and supports homosexuality.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) \u2013 helps Member States fight drugs, crime, and terrorism. Promotes all forms of contraception, helps in the distribution of condoms, and supports homosexuality.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) \u2013 is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, and every young person\u2019s potential is fulfilled. The whole focus of the UNFPA is the push of all forms of birth control, including abortifacient contraception. The UNFPA also pushes homosexuality rights and access to so-called \u2018safe\u2019 abortion.\n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \u2013 established in 1972, is the voice for the environment within the United Nations system. UNEP acts as a catalyst, advocate, educator and facilitator to promote the wise use and sustainable development of the global environment. UNEP calls for \u201cmaking modern contraception accessible to all,\u201d pushes the myth of overpopulation and encourages the use of contraception to combat overpopulation.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) \u2013 has contributed to the welfare and human development of four generations of Palestine refugees. Its services encompass education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, microfinance and emergency assistance, including in times of armed conflict. It reports only to the UN General Assembly. UNRWA provides the full range of contraceptives, including abortifacients.\n\nUN Women \u2013 merges and builds on the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN system, which focus exclusively on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. UN Women advocates for access to all forms of contraception and abortion, affirms that sterilization as a form of contraception should be available to all, and promotes homosexual rights.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the beginning of this article, we quoted Bishop Sorondo, Chancellor for the Pontifical Academy for Science, who said \u201cThe Holy See does not see the United Nations as the devil,\u201d and who attempted to claim that \u201cfamily planning and reproductive and sexual health and rights\u201d may be interpreted \u201cas Paul VI, in terms of responsible paternity and maternity.\u201d\n\nAs has been seen, the United Nations was brought into creation and led by a Communist and has had socialist and pro-abortion leaders ever since. We have also seen that agencies of the United Nations are deeply involved in the promotion of abortion, contraception, homosexuality, and the myth of overpopulation. In our previous article, we even illustrated how the Sustainable Development Goals are aligned with the goals of Communism. Given the socialist leadership of the United Nations, it\u2019s clear that this alignment is not incidental or mere happenstance.\n\nTaken together, it simply is not reasonable to conclude in any way that the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, or any other UN agenda for that matter, can or will be interpreted in line with Catholic thinking. Because of this, goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals must be forcefully opposed by Catholics everywhere. Unfortunately, Vatican officials and agencies are going out of their way to promote the Sustainable Development Goals, flippantly dismissing any concerns as \u201cright-wingers who believe that the United Nations is the Devil.\u201d If proponents of the UN don\u2019t see it as a devilish threat to the faithful, perhaps they don\u2019t believe in the devil, either."], ["http://fatherpaulnicholson.blogspot.com/2015/06/st-josemaria-escriva-just-say-no-to.html", "Just Say No to 'Stupido'!", "Please consider supporting my ministry with a financial donation of any size.\n\nOne Time Donation\n\n\n\nMonthly donation\n\n$10 / month $25 / month $50 / month $100 / month\n\n\n\nAll donations are tax deductible in Canada"], ["http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/09/rubio-on-jihadists-we-will-look-for-you-we-will-find-you-and-we-will-kill-you/", "'We Will Look for You, We Will Kill You'", "GREENVILLE, South Carolina \u2013 GOP presidential candidate Sen.

Ramos (rhetorically) asks a simple question: \u201cHow are you going to deport 11 million (illegal alien) people\u2026(?)\u201d This simple question has a simple rational answer: If you (1) take away food stamps and welfare; (2) make them pay for their own medical and educational expenses and (3) strictly enforce e-verify, then most of his (11 million) people would deport themselves.\n\nThere are two parts to any political decision process: reason and emotion. In the immigration debate, Team-Patriot (our side) won the reason part long ago. Therefore Team-Anchor-Babe (their side) must fall back on two defensive strategies: Sophistry and Synthetic Sentimentality often delivered by Guerrilla Theater . Our side must adjust tactics accordingly.\n\nThe second part clause of his question injects sophistry: \u201c\u2026will you use the army..?\u201d He has posited that Trump has proposed doing something that is complex, expensive and highly unpleasant. No one on our side has ever proposed using the Army. Our side has proposed is that we stop something: We should stop subsidizing the slow colonization of our nation by a foreign people.\n\nIn addition, with his use of the word \u201cArmy,\u201d Ramos has injected an element of Synthetic Sentimentality i.e. emotional bullying. He hopes to evoke a parallel between uniformed agents of the U.S. government (the Army) \u201crounding up\u201d the poor Mexicans and the uniformed agents of the Nazis (the Waffen S.S) \u201crounding up\u201d the family of poor Ann Frank.\n\nAnother example of this Synthetic Sentimentality illustrated by a recent Scott Walker\u2019s confrontation in Wisconsin. Here, an illegal alien \u201cmother,\u201d anchor baby in-tow, complains to the candidate, \u201cWhy do you want to break my family apart?\u201d There are two interesting features of this confrontation. First the \u201cbreak-apart family\u201d seems to be well groomed, well behaved, photogenic, and well-rehearsed. The \u201cfather\u201d speaks English, not fluently, but well enough to be understood and pitied. This attempt of generating Synthetic Sentimentality for their \u201canchor baby\u201d looks suspiciously like well-planned and skillfully executed Guerilla Theater\n\nThe second feature was the tactical asymmetry. Walker was calm, polite was talking rule of law (rational). On the other hand, the illegal alien was talking about his fears (emotional) while attempting evoke pity (emotional). This Guerilla Theater stunt will certainly be repeated in the future and we should be prepared.\n\nOn one hand our candidate must appear dignified, in control and presidential. Note that Trump did act this way with Ramos but Bernie Sanders did not act this way when confronted by Black Lives Matter activists. On the other hand, if the Guerilla actors are not dealt with, we risk every public event to becoming a freak-show.\n\nMy suggestion is that we be prepared to upstage any attempt at Guerilla Theater with Guerilla Opera. Consider again the Trump-Ramos incident: After line jumping, Ramos had a hissy-fit because Trump refused to answer his foolish question. In this incident, Trump\u2019s body guard escorted the pest from the room.\n\nConsider an alternate scenario: Suppose Trump, Cruz or another immigration patriot were asked a similar question in a town hall meeting. At first, our man would answer rationally and politely. However, I strongly suspect that the guerilla thespian, like Romos, would persist. After all, the purpose of their question is not a request for information but rather an attempt to embarrass and evoke sympathy on a carefully edited You Tube clip.\n\nOnce it becomes clear what the illegal is doing, our candidate should then ask one of his staff to answer the persistent inquisitor. Rather than speaking an answer this man, is quickly joined by three other men who start singing an answer: This Guerilla Opera would use a quartet, singing A Capella, in perfect well-rehearsed harmony, a parody of a well-known Naval Ballad:\n\nAnc-hor-Babes go away[1]\n\nAnchors Away\n\nNo Welfare, No Food Stamps, you\u2019ll leave at break of day\n\nE-verify you\u2019ll find, where \u2018er you roam\n\nIf you hate \u201crule-of-law\u201d then YOU can leave for THIS is not your HOME!\n\nDevastatingly simple, the Guerilla Quartet would actually answer Jorge-like question without getting sucked in his sophistry. In addition, if most of the crowd is passionate for our man, they will join in as well. Jerry Springer would be jealous.\n\nToo many conservatives tend to be too intellectual and actually believe that Team-Anchor-Babe wishes to have a rational discussion. They are only interested in Sophistry, Synthetic Sentimentality and name calling, e.g. La Raza calling us \u201cracists.\u201d\n\nOf course reason is on our side, but sometimes the truth needs the constant repetition[2] and the methodic passion of music. Remember \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic?\u201d Our enemies are skillful in generating synthetic compassion as a weapon against the very survival of our civilization. American civilization is based on the \u201crule of law.\u201d If these colonists -- who call themselves emigrants -- don\u2019t respect our laws, they should find another nation to colonize.\n\nLet\u2019s sing it!"], ["http://www.vdare.com/posts/cartoon-africa-dumping-its-wretched-refuse-on-europe", "VDARE - premier news outlet for patriotic immigration reform", "I suppose the cartoon above (source) with it\u2019s trashcan metaphor will be considered racist, even though the artist hasn\u2019t made much effort to make the dumpees look like Third-Worlders.

Generally, these have come from punitive measures. In addition to added regulations on food producers, they have struck directly at the consumer, in the form of \u201csin taxes\u201d on sodas and other foods high in sugar and cholesterol in an \u201caltruistic\u201d attempt to persuade Americans to eat healthier. While I tend to disagree with these tactics and believe that the usage of state power to drive our consumer choices is a form of tyranny, I do believe there is a role to be played by the government and political parties as related to manufacturers grocery coupons not only to help poor and working class families stretch their food budget, but to also make more efficient use of the trillions in taxpayers money that is spent on relief and assistance programs.\n\nThe American culture has become synonymous with \u201cconsumerism\u201d for at least the last half century. In the post-World War II boom, Americans developed a purchasing power, at the time, greater than any other civilization on the earth. It was not long before manufacturers and retailers began expanding the use of coupons to drive consumer behavior and sales of their products and services. Today, market trends indicate that frequent coupon enthusiasts shop more often and account for more purchases than non-coupon users, which is to be expected. However, the families who can most benefit from coupon savings are the least likely to use them. While legislators have become increasingly interested in using the state to drive how consumers make their choices, they have paid little if no attention to ways to increase money-saving coupon usage among America\u2019s poor and lower-income families.\n\nIt was my mother who first introduced me to coupons, but I became a confirmed \u201ccoupon nut\u201d with the impending birth of my own daughter eight years ago. Faced with the knowledge (and fear) of having to stretch our family budget even further, I jumped on the coupon bandwagon with full steam, becoming obsessed with saving every nickel possible. Fortunately for me and my family, this was during the days of \u201cdouble coupons\u201d which reaped a bonanza which bordered on hording behavior. Coupon clipping became a Sunday ritual which I\u2019m embarrassed to say I practiced with more consistency than Church attendance. I would brew a piping hot pot of coffee, sit myself in front of the television, scissors in hand to enjoy hours of NFL football and a gleeful pursuit of the weekly deals offered by my favorite and soon-to-be favorite brands.\n\nI became so proficient in the practice that I set up extra shelves in my garage to store the bevy of products that overflowed our cabinets. I would stand in awe of my accomplishments, admiring the rows and rows of baby shampoo, wipes, lotions, oils and products that if used quadruple to their normal pace would still not place a dent in the inventory. I can\u2019t tell you how many times a I took advantage of regular sales on baby products at $2, applied a $1 coupon, which doubled, and provided my daughter a free bottle of name brand baby lotion, shampoo and other pampering products to the point that we ultimately gave away many bottles to friends and family members with babies of their own as gift baskets.\n\nThis fanaticism spread to our other purchases as well, as I would anxiously await the grocery receipt, eager to scan down to the bottom to view my savings and calculate the percentage savings and marvel at my own consumer brilliance. Aside from the ego boost, it provided us with true value and enabled us to enjoy a wider selection of grocery items and translated into more disposable income for family outings, more evenings of dining out and better accommodations on vacations.\n\nMost Americans have used a coupon of some sort at one time or another. Whether to save money at an amusement park, free popcorn at the movie theater or a free beer at a ball game, all of us have taken advantage of a spontaneous deal at some point. However when it comes to our most consistent and essential purchases, food and groceries, a distinct pattern of the typical coupon users has developed for decades that may surprise some. The fact of the matter is that middle-class families utilize money-saving grocery coupons more than any other group and in fact wealthy Americans are more likely to lay down a $0.50 coupon for mayonnaise than the poorest of Americans.\n\nThe image above demonstrates the use of grocery coupons by income bracket. As show, while families with an annual incomes between $45k and above use coupons at a disproportionate rate. Sadly, the families that would benefit most from stretching out their food budget are least likely to take advantage of savings offered by manufacturers, as for families with less than $25k in annual income make up only 14 percent of all coupon users, while making more than 28 percent of the nation. While this of course translates to these families spending more of their budget on the daily necessity of food, it also leads to less healthy eating habits and one could argue less appetizing.\n\nThis should be of particular interest to conservatives as we look at the dual challenges of moving toward a society that is less dependent on government while at the same time expanding our base to include a more competitive position in the ghettos, barrios and trailer parks of America. In developing strategies to utilize the enormous savings power of manufacturers coupons, we can work toward accomplishing both goals, albeit in a step by step process. Reality dictates that we must understand we cannot simply wave a magic wand and alleviate problems that have been half a century in the making, but we can utilize the power of government, as it was designed, to chip away at the welfare state and the debilitating effect it has had on taxpayer and recipient alike.\n\nAs we first look at practical steps to be taken within the current welfare and SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) programs, technology can be utilized to both drive consumer behaviors and make better use of the hard-earned money of the taxpayer, while we embark on efforts to create a future economic climate where self-determination and responsibility becomes the national mantra. To fellow conservatives who balk at the notion of betraying principle by even entertaining the subject I will retort that the situation of SNAP and food stamps is a problem that we can either employ long-term and incremental solutions at or continue to acquiesce the conversation (and votes) to the left-wing, who is vested in growing the welfare state. We should never be confused in that the ultimate goal is elimination of the need but this is not going to happen overnight and as Christians, Jews and believers of other faiths we should also contemplate that our opponents have set the stage for this dependence and we are obligated to teach our brethren how to fish as we work to reverse the cycle the left has wrought.\n\nWithin the SNAP program there are opportunities to bring coupons into the system. Here is where the state can work in conjunction with business, not as an adversary. The technology already exists so that money-saving coupon codes can be embedded into the EBT (Electronic Benefit Cards) that most recipients of state assistance utilize. Just as with the middle-class shopper who either clips or (increasingly) uploads the coupons to a phone app or their grocery \u201cclub-cards\u201d and realizes these savings at the check-out line upon purchase, food-stamp recipients who swipe an EBT card will have the manufacturers offers deducted from their totals.\n\nThis provides two options available, depending on how this sort of program is rolled-out. The \u201csavings\u201d can either be transparent to the recipient and come back to state coffers, just as manufactures fund grocery retailers, or can be \u201cbonus-ed\u201d back to the recipient themselves with all or part of the discounted balance being maintained in their EBT account. This aspect is certainly up for debate but if we are to use such a system to drive behavior, it stands to reason that providing incentive to the shopper to purchase discounted products will be more expeditious to this goal.\n\nManufacturers would certainly be open to such proposals, as it helps increase market share, just as standard coupon usage does. The metrics alone open up huge consumer opportunities for them to participate, even be the drivers, of a system that will provide savings to the taxpayer, regardless of which methodology is used. Even if we came to the decision that developing better consumer habits was a fruitless venture (of which I disagree), we can immediately save taxpayer money increasing coupon usage for state-subsidized grocery purchases.\n\nThis brings us to the educational aspect of the issue. Everything about the administering of left-wing social welfare programs has had the consequence of eradicating self-determination and self-responsibility and further increasing need and numbers of the indigent. As we work on one side of the coin to create an economic climate with more opportunity, we need to also focus energy on on reversing these conditions. Whereas the state\u2019s role in this should be limited to education and awareness and aforementioned budgetary savings techniques. conservative outreach into areas traditionally controlled by Democrats and the Progressive-left provide opportunities. Social conservatives and faith-based groups have been successfully utilizing coupon classes and giveaways in their outreach and by implementing such strategies we can go a long way into showing the residents of these communities that we in fact have not only their interest at heart but also tangible ideas to put money back into their pockets, which is ultimately the crux of modern conservatism.\n\nI\u2019ve always held that the importance (and pitfalls) of political leadership is not simply in policy initiative or tax tables, but its cultural influence as well. We certainly have seen the effect of Progressive-liberalism in the trend of hedonism and the breakdown of the traditional family on the entire culture. If we are going to push toward a century where personal responsibility and self-determination are re-established as American virtues, we have to take the lead in showing the citizenry the path. By taking an active role in educating families on how to get more \u201cbang for their buck\u201d we can open minds up to a better way and show the beauty and dignity of being in control of one\u2019s own life. Whereas the left-wing hopes to make the indigent grateful, and therefore beholden, to the state providing them with their daily bread, conservatives can educate families to empower themselves and if anything be appreciative for this knowledge and disprove the fear mongering of the left who consistently warn them of the \u201cnefarious\u201d motives of the right.\n\nWe find ourselves at a crucial juncture in the history of America. The Progressive-left has made no secret of their desire to \u201cfundamentally transform America\u201d and have skillfully utilized the social-welfare system to do just that. In twenty years time, given the current increase in bureaucratic reach, it will be too late to stop them. By getting involved in the battle with practical solutions that positively have a change on not only families bottom lines but their attitudes and behaviors, we can stem the tide of dependence. Grocery store coupons alone will not solve the problem, but they are one way to help conservatives and the Republican Party connect with poorer Americans and help spread the gospel of self-respect, dignity and above all self-determination.\n\nBy Paul M Winters\n\nEditor in Chief, Dignitas News Service\n\nSources:\n\nJillCataldo\n\nCornellUniversity\n\nAnnBrumbaughMarketing\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nStumbleUpon\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], ["http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2015/09/19/sen-rand-paul-says-donald-trump-has-peaked/72486434/", "Sen.

The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63). This doesn\u2019t mean that it is unlimited, the same as all rights (more on that below). However, the court states that even though gun violence is a problem to be taken seriously, \u201cthe enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table\u201d (p.64).\n\n6. The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this. It\u2019s listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (\u201csecurity of a free state\u201d), then the people need arms: \u201cWhen the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny\u201d (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted \u201cthat history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents\u201d (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: \u201cduring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive\u201d (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens\u2019 militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).\n\n7. The Second Amendment was also meant as a provision to repel a foreign army invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find this one comical, but it\u2019s in there. The court notes one of many reasons for the militia to ensure a free state was \u201cit is useful in repelling invasions\u201d (p.24). This provision, like tyranny, isn\u2019t an everyday occurring use of the right; more like a once-in-a-century (if that) kind of provision. A popular myth from World War II holds Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese navy allegedly said \u201cYou cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\u201d Although there is no evidence of him saying this, there was concern that Japan might invade during WWII. Japan did invade Alaska, which was a U.S. territory at the time, and even today on the West Coast there are still gun embankments from the era (now mostly parks). The fact is that there are over 310 million firearms in the United States as of 2009, making a foreign invasion success less likely (that, and the U.S. military is arguably the strongest in the world).\n\n8. The Second Amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t unlimited: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d (p. 54). The Court upheld restrictions like the prohibition of arms by felons and the mentally ill, and carrying in certain prohibited places like schools and courthouses. What is protected are weapons \u201cin common use of the time\u201d (p.55). This doesn\u2019t mean weapons in common use \u201cat that time,\u201d meaning the 18th Century. The Court said the idea that it would is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\u201d (p.8). The Court\u2019s criteria includes weapons in popular widespread use \u201cthat [are] overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d (p. 56), and \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans\u201d (p. 58).\n\n9. The Second Amendment might require full-blown military arms to fulfill the original intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court didn\u2019t rule specifically on this in D.C. v. Heller, but noting that weapon technology has drastically changed (mentioning modern day bombers and tanks), they stated \u201cthe conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large\u201d (p. 55).\n\nThey further added that \u201cthe fact that modern developments [in modern weaponry] have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right\u201d (p. 56). A full ruling has not been made, as this was not in the scope the court was asked to rule on in the D.C. v. Heller case, but they left the door open for future ruling.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Feb 8, 2013.

Then there was her accusation that Bill and Monica were all part of \"a vast right wing conspiracy.\" Eight month later, after a number of terror attacks on our embassies while we were fixated on the latest Clinton scandal, we learned that it really was Bill and Monica after all.

Barnewall -- American Matrix: How We Lost Our Constitution, Part 2", "AMERICAN MATRIX: HOW WE LOST OUR CONSTITUTION\n\nPART 2\n\nBy Marilyn MacGruder Barnewall\n\nJanuary 16, 2015\n\nNewsWithViews.com\n\nCOLORABLE MONEY, COLORABLE LAW, COLORABLE LIBERTY\n\nBefore providing you with the following information, I must state that I am not an attorney and have not studied the law. I\u2019m a retired banker who has done a lot of research on this subject.\n\nWhat we learned in Part I is that federal, state, county and city governments and most of the departments and divisions that are part of them are incorporated. We learned that corporations function under Articles of Incorporation, not a Constitution and that\u2019s how we lost our constitutional rights and courts that support them.\n\nWe learned that corporations are governed by business laws having to do with Maritime Law (also called Law of the Seas or Admiralty Law both of which are historically very old) and the Uniform Commercial Code. We learned that Constitutional Law is based on Common Law (which is based on substance and the will of the people -- the Will of God, too, many people say). For example, under Common Law we are provided the alternative of not testifying against ourselves; that is not part of Maritime Law.\n\nTo understand the damage that has been done to our nation, we need to define the word \u201ccolorable\u201d \u2013 its meaning, its impact on our currency, our courts, and our constitutional liberties and the limits the Constitution places on government. It is from the meaning of the word \u201ccolorable\u201d that the virus of death infecting our nation breeds and keeps breeding\u2026 like Ebola, it dissolves every major life-giving organ in its path until death ensues.\n\nCOLORABLE MONEY - COLORABLE COURTS\n\nTo be \u201ccolorable,\u201d is for something to appear to be what it is not. It looks real, you are told by your government that it is real and, in the example of currency, it is used or behaves as if it\u2019s real, but it is not. Take what you are told is a dollar bill from your billfold. It looks like a dollar bill. You can spend it like a dollar bill. But it is not a dollar bill. It is a Federal Reserve Note. It says so, right on the face of it \u2013 at the top, above George Washington\u2019s picture.\n\nIn the world of banking, what is a note? Answer: It is a loan. It is credit. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, fiat money has no value in and of itself, but it can be exchanged\u2026 like Monopoly money. A direct quote from the Minneapolis Fed: \u2026(fiat currency can be exchanged) \u201cfor goods and services\u2026 because (the people) are confident it will be honored when they buy goods and services.\u201d\n\nMoney and currency are not the same. We used to have money in America but when the dollar was no longer backed by gold or silver our \u201cmoney\u201d became a fiat currency. These things called a \u201cFederal Reserve Note\u201d became colorable currency, something that behaved like money because people could use it to buy groceries, cars, electronics, etc., and also pay for services like health care and life insurance. But it was not money. It was colorable\u2026 it just serves as a paper currency. Money is something of substance \u2013 like gold or silver. For Common Law to exist, money of substance must exist.\n\nIf a (colorable) Federal Reserve Note becomes part of a contract, the contract also becomes colorable. Colorable contracts, in turn, must be adjudicated under a \u201ccolorable\u201d jurisdiction (system of justice \u2013 our courts). So when the colorable currency called Federal Reserve Notes was created, the government had to create a jurisdiction (court system) to cover colorable contracts. The incorporated governments called this new form of jurisdiction Statutory Law because though it was based on the Uniform Commercial Code which is based on Admiralty Law, \u201cStatutory\u201d is neither. Thus, Statutory Jurisdiction is colorable.\n\nIt sounds complicated, but if you think about it for a few minutes, it is really quite simple. Public Law was used in Common Law courts; Public Policy is used in Statutory courts... and that's what gave bureaucrats control of our courtrooms. That's what gave them the ability to prosecute members of the public because a regulation passed by a government agency rather than a law passed by Congress or your State Legislature, was violated.\n\nSo our courts have changed\u2026 how many times in the past years have you heard the term \u201cThe Petitioner does not have Standing to file this case\u2026 dismissed!\u201d We have been unable to file cases against our government even when clear abuses of power exist. How many juries have been given rules they are told they must follow in determining a verdict, leaving them no choice other than \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty\u201d regardless of what the evidence indicates? How many judges have withheld evidence from a jury? It has brought topics like \u201cNullification\u201d to the forefront of the politically active. Nullification deals with a jury\u2019s right to dismiss from its decision of guilt or innocence the judge\u2019s directions as to what the jury may or may not consider in reaching its decision. Juries are empowered to nullify the judge\u2019s directions if they feel it is justified.\n\nAll of this and more has been caused by the change from Common to a colorable form of Maritime Law called Statutory Law\u2026 a form of law required when our various governments incorporated -- which, in turn, was required when the Federal Reserve System presented us with a \"colorable currency.\"\n\nWhat have we Americans been taught by our government-subsidized education about the cause of our Revolutionary War? Mostly we were told about the Boston Tea Party, the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, and other nice stories.\n\nMany people say the Revolution began because of the Crown\u2019s Declaratory Act which taxed tea, taxed stamps, forced colonists to quarter in their homes members of the English military, etc. No. It began because of the Rothschilds and their central bank system which, in today\u2019s world, has driven us to the brink of another world war.\n\nIt\u2019s true that all those things were great irritants, but the real core problem involved central banking \u2013 the Bank of England. The colonists were forced by England\u2019s King to use a paper currency issued by the Bank of England which demanded we use it \u2013 and we were to cede our colonial banking and monetary systems and pay interest to the Bank of England for using their paper money.\n\nIt sounds eerily like the way the Federal Reserve System in America works today, doesn\u2019t it? It is, in fact, quite similar. So we must start with the assumption that what made our ancestors go to war in the 1700s is quite acceptable to Americans today because we have embraced what they were willing to die to prevent: Central banks and a fiat currency.\n\nThe Rothschilds were around when America was a colony of Great Britain and the fact that we were founded on the basis of Common Law troubled them. Why? Common Law is based on substance and rejects \u201ccolorable money\u201d and \u201ccolorable courts.\u201d Article 1 Section 8 of our Constitution describes for you what \u201csubstance\u201d relative to Common Law means: \u201cGold and silver,\u201d not a meaningless fiat currency that has nothing backing it. That is a currency with no substance and violates Common Law.\n\nPrior to the forming of the Federal Reserve System, America\u2019s Constitutional Republic required the nation to pay its debts in gold or silver and Rothschild banks did not loan gold or silver. Thus they did not like our newly-formed government which rejected a fiat currency with nothing backing it (what we have today). As described above, the Rothschilds allowed the King of England to borrow paper money from them and got repaid in gold and silver.\n\nOur Constitution declared gold and silver as the official currency of the United States of America and that\u2019s why the Rothschilds financed the War of 1812. They wanted America as part of the United Kingdom so they could expand into the New World their Bank of England scam. They of course lost the War of 1812 and began seeking other ways to further their \u201cwe\u2019ll loan you paper and you pay us back in gold and silver\u201d scheme and began working on what we now have as a central banking system, the Federal Reserve, founded on December 23, 1913, 100 years after the War of 1812. And how legitimate is the Federal Reserve Act of 1913? Not very. Read the history.\n\nOur ancestors in North America began to revolt against the Brits but we had Common Law in the Colonies at the time. When the King\u2019s tax collectors made their rounds, however, they imposed Admiralty Law on the people. It enabled them to arrest and quickly try people, denying to what were mostly Englishmen and women the common rights due them as citizens of the Crown. That is what caused the Revolutionary War.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of our history is that almost exactly the same thing has happened to us once again. What\u2019s the old saying about what happens if we don\u2019t learn from history? By incorporating federal, state, and county governments (because of the Federal Reserve\u2019s colorable currency), the U.S. Government made it possible to remove the Common Law supported by our U.S. Constitution and implement a prostituted form of Maritime (or Admiralty) Law called Statutory Law. Our ancestors refused to tolerate it and it will be interesting to see if today\u2019s society which seems more motivated by security and comfort than by right and wrong and liberty will accept the Law of the Seas.\n\nTo make sure we\u2019re all on the same page, let\u2019s start with some definitions and let them guide you to an understanding of how we got in our current mess. Only if we understand the history behind these massive problems will we be able to solve them.\n\nTo explain how the loss of Common Law robbed us of our independence and our Republic and how incorporating federal, state, and county governments made it possible, we need some definitions. You\u2019re about to get a graduate school crash course in business and finance (and a little law):\n\nJURISDICTION: 1. The right of a court to hear a particular case, based on the scope of its authority over the type of case and the parties to the case. 2. Authority or control. 3. The extent of authority or control. 4. The territorial range of authority or control.\n\nWhile researching the jurisdiction of our courts, I came upon an article that was so well done, so easy for a non-lawyer to understand, I decided to reprint portions of it here. One of the difficult things about writing both Parts I and II of this article is stating things in a way that can be understood by non-bankers and non-lawyers. Since I\u2019m not a lawyer, I particularly appreciated this article and recommend that you read it in its entirety HERE. I am not publishing the entire article below, just those parts that apply to this topic.\n\nThe article is a condensed story about a man named Howard Freeman and is based on a seminar Freeman gave in 1990. The article is written in ham and eggs English and is not filled with legal terminology that forces you to look every-other-word up in a legal dictionary. The following definition about Common Law, Equity Law, Admiralty/Maritime Law, Courts of Contract, Colorable Money and Colorable Courts, and the Uniform Commercial Code is taken from that seminar and the article written about it.\n\nThe Constitution of the United States mentions three areas of jurisdiction in which the courts may operate:\n\nCOMMON LAW\n\nCommon Law is based on God's law. Anytime someone is charged under the Common Law, there must be a damaged party. You are free under the Common Law to do anything you please, as long as you do not infringe on the life, liberty, or property of someone else. You have a right to make a fool of yourself provided you do not infringe on the life, liberty, or property of someone else. The Common Law does not allow for any government action which prevents a man from making a fool of himself. For instance, when you cross over the state lines in most states, you will see a sign which says, \" BUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELTS - IT'S THE LAW. \" This cannot be Common Law, because who would you injure if you did not buckle up? Nobody. This would be compelled performance. But Common Law cannot compel performance. Any violation of Common Law is a CRIMINAL ACT, and is punishable.\n\nEQUITY LAW\n\nEquity Law is law which compels performance. It compels you to perform to the exact letter of any contract that you are under. So, if you have compelled performance, there must be a contract somewhere, and you are being compelled to perform under the obligation of the contract. Now this can only be a civil action - not criminal. In Equity Jurisdiction, you cannot be tried criminally, but you can be compelled to perform to the letter of a contract. If you then refuse to perform as directed by the court, you can be charged with contempt of court, which is a criminal action. Are our seatbelt laws Equity Laws? No, they are not, because you cannot be penalized or punished for not keeping to the letter of a contract. (BARNEWALL NOTE: You may have signed an insurance contract agreeing to always wear your seat belts or otherwise obey all traffic laws and, of course, your state requires automobile insurance coverage.)\n\nADMIRALTY/MARITIME LAW\n\nThis is civil jurisdiction of Compelled Performance which also has Criminal Penalties for not adhering to the letter of the contract, but this only applies to International Contracts. Now we can see what jurisdiction the seatbelt laws (all traffic codes, etc) are under. Whenever there is a penalty for failure to perform (such as willful failure to file), that is Admiralty/Maritime Law and there must be a valid international contract in force.\n\nHowever, the courts don't want to admit that they are operating under Admiralty/Maritime Jurisdictions, so they took the international law or Law Merchant and adopted it into our codes. That is what the Supreme Court decided in the Erie Railroad case (Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, Supreme Court, 1938) - that the decisions will be based on commercial law or business law and that it will have criminal penalties associated with it. Since they were instructed not to call it Admiralty Jurisdiction, they call it Statutory Jurisdiction.\n\nCOURTS OF CONTRACT\n\nYou must ask how we got into this situation where we can be charged with failure to wear seatbelts and be fined for it. Isn't the judge sworn to up hold the Constitution? Yes, he is. But you must understand the Constitution, in Article I, \u00a7 10, gives us the unlimited right to contract, as long as we do not infringe on the life, liberty or property of someone else. Contracts are enforceable, and the Constitution gives two jurisdictions where contracts can be enforced - Equity or Admiralty. But we find them being in Statutory Jurisdiction. This is the embarrassing part for the courts, but we can use this to box the judges into a corner in their own courts.\n\nCONTRACTS MUST BE VOLUNTARY\n\nUnder the Common Law, every contract must be entered into knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally by both parties or it is void and unenforceable. This is characteristic: It must be based on substance. For example, contracts used to read, \"For one dollar and other valuable considerations, I will paint your house,\u201d etc. That was a valid contract - the dollar was a genuine, silver dollar. Now, suppose you wrote a contract that said, \"For one Federal Reserve Note and other considerations, I will paint your house....\" And suppose, for example, I painted your house the wrong color. Could you go into a Common Law court and get justice? No, you could not. You see, a Federal Reserve Note is a \"colorable\" dollar, as it has no substance, and in a Common Law Jurisdiction, that contract would be unenforceable.\n\nCOLORABLE MONEY - COLORABLE COURTS\n\nColorable: That which exists in appearance only, and not in reality; not what it purports to be, hence counterfeit, feigned have the appearance of truth. Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition.\n\nIt is \"colorable\" Admiralty Jurisdiction the judges are enforcing because we are using \"colorable money.\" Colorable Admiralty is now known as Statutory Jurisdiction. Let's see how we got under this Statutory Jurisdiction.\n\nUNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE\n\nThe government set up a \"colorable\" law system to fit the \"colorable\" currency. It used to be called the Law Merchant or the Law of Redeemable Instruments, because it dealt with paper which was redeemable in something of substance. But, once Federal Reserve Notes had become unredeemable, there had to be a system of law which was completely \"colorable\" from start to finish. This system of law was codified as the Uniform Commercial Code, and has been adopted in every state. This is \"colorable\" law, and it is used in all the courts.\n\n(End of text from Howard Freeman\u2019s seminar.)\n\nDo you see how the Federal Reserve Notes were the basic cause of the problems we now see in our courts, our financial system, our Republic, our Independence as a people? They created a fiat currency backed by nothing. Keep in mind, the word \u201cNote\u201d means \u201cLoan.\u201d It is \u201ccolorable currency.\u201d\n\nThe Common Law, as embodied in the US Constitution, for the protection and security of persons and property, is Substantive Common Law - [substantive right: a right {as of life, liberty, property, or reputation} held to exist for its own sake and to constitute part of the normal legal order of society] - the intention of the Founding Fathers being the assurance of access to this law by the people.\n\nThe most important thing we the people can work to achieve is Constitutional Counties. This system was imposed on us from the top down and must be unwound from the bottom up.\n\nAs I said in Part I of this article, corporations can be dissolved \u2013 and we need to do that. It\u2019s not difficult to achieve\u2026 get enough signatures on a petition to get the initiative on your county ballot and vote the corporations out of existence.\n\nIt is, however, more difficult than it sounds. It requires extensive planning because you must remember how we got from a Constitutional Republic to Crony Capitalism. Here\u2019s what I think happened.\n\nThe Federal Reserve came into being in 1913. Our money was turned into a fiat currency when President Nixon took us off of the gold standard. The U.S. Government was based on Common Law which made colorable money (money lacking substance \u2013 Common Law is based on substance) and that made it impossible for it to continue issuing Federal Reserve Notes. So the federal government incorporated itself which made it possible for them to continue with the issuance of Federal Reserve Notes. It became clear that the states could not accept colorable money from an incorporated federal government unless they, too, were incorporated \u2013 and the same thing happened to our counties. To gain access to a colorable currency, an entire system had to be created. How much simpler our lives would be if the Treasury Department had taken over America\u2019s monetary system rather than build this octopus so the Federal Reserve System could be maintained! This attests to the power of the Rothschild central banking system. We might want to keep in mind that one of the primary problems in the Middle East is that Islam does not allow loan usury (interest) and not all of the nations in the Middle East have central banks. Libya didn\u2019t have one \u2013 until Muammar Gaddafi was removed from office and killed. Libya now has a central bank. (The Stylebook at the Washington Post spells it \"Gaddafi.\" The Stylebook at the Associated Press spells it \"Gadhafi.\")\n\nThough it is not difficult to dissolve the corporations if it is the will of the people to regain their constitutional rights, a great deal of thought must go into how a county that dissolves its corporations will survive without federal and state dollars. Some of the questions that arise are:\n\n1. If Common Law is returned to our court system and our governing bodies, it requires a currency that has substance and contracts based on that substance. Fiat currency \u2013 Federal Reserve Notes \u2013 has no substance. How can those people being paid by the federal, state, or county governments get paid in a currency of substance? How about people receiving Social Security and Medicare benefits? How about veterans receiving retirement and VA benefits? They are being paid in Federal Reserve Notes (as we all are) which, since they are not redeemable in gold or silver, are deemed as having no substance and contracts with no substance are rejected by Common Law. This part of problem resolution is complex \u2013 but with good planning it can be done.\n\n2. Can fiat currency be used at all in a Constitutional County?\n\n3. Is there a way to reject the colorable Statutory Laws created by federal and state governments and build a bridge between Common Law and the Uniform Commercial Code, Admiralty/Maritime Law, Equity Law, etc.?\n\nThere are many other questions, but to ask and answer them requires a book, not an article. The purpose of this two-part article has been to explain to you what I believe happened and what I believe the solution to be. It will not be easy. Nor will it be free.\n\nLiberty is never free. How much you value it will determine the price you are willing to pay to regain it.\n\n[The book: The Coming Battle, published in 1899, documents how the politicians of that period didn't want the debt to be paid off. They wanted the debt to be rolled over from generation to generation. It continues to this day. It's a must read.]\n\nClick here for part -----> 1,\n\n\u00a9 2015 Marilyn M.

After all, it was wealth just waiting to be unleashed.\n\nYet paradoxically, on the eve of the Abundance Revolution, many of America\u2019s leaders, on the right as well as the left, were preaching a strict doctrine of overall austerity.\n\nIndeed, as we look back and study the events of 2014, we can see the results of the Green elite\u2019s ideologically-driven effort to squelch even the relatively small amount of prosperity that Americans were then enjoying. That is, it was the Green elites who unwittingly opened the door to the Abundance Revolution and the fantastic increase in wealth that Americans have since realized over the last half-century.\n\nWe can point to three events, all occurring in April 2014.\n\nThe first triggering event, now the stuff of lore and legend, was the incident in Bunkerville, Nevada, in which Cliven Bundy, then an anonymous citizen, joined by several hundred supporters, faced down a federal army led by an ally of then-Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV). The incident began on April 5, 2014, when the federal government attempted to seize Bundy\u2019s property; that attempt, which struck many as overkill, led to a series of confrontations that ultimately inspired national news coverage.\n\nWhat highlighted the incident further were the comments of Sen. Reid, who referred to Bundy and his allies as \u201cterrorists.\u201d That seemed such an excessive reaction that observers grew curious as to why Reid felt so strongly.\n\nSome clues as to the government\u2019s behavior were found in an opinion piece on Fox News by Wayne Allyn Root, the future national leader, in which Root asked, \u201cWhy is US Senator Harry Reid so concerned with a local Nevada rancher?\u201d Presciently, Root noted that Reid allies were involved in \u201cgreen energy\u201d efforts, which required vast tracts of land for solar facilities. As Root opined:\n\nReid and the BLM [Bureau of Land Management, a now-defunct federal agency] needed a \u201ccover story\u201d to take the land away from the ranchers. So they claim it\u2019s about protecting the \u201cendangered\u201d desert tortoise. But if the protection of the desert tortoise was so important to the BLM, why did the same BLM kill hundreds of desert tortoises last fall? If protecting the tortoises was so important, why has the BLM constantly waived rules protecting the desert tortoise for multiple solar and wind projects? If cattle are a danger to tortoises, why are solar panels and wind turbines not a danger?\n\nRoot concluded, \u201cThere\u2019s much more to this story.\u201d Then he added:\n\nMy educated guess is that someone in the government already has big plans lined up for the Bundy Ranch. Someone is going to make a financial killing with this forceful land grab. Someone powerful in government wants the Bundy family off their land (after 140 years).\n\nExactly. Root\u2019s suspicions were vindicated, as we know, in surprising ways that made Root famous and left Reid\u2019s career and reputation in ruins.\n\nThe second triggering incident occurred a few hundred miles away in Salt Lake City on April 17, 2014. The first of a series of assemblies of local officials and state land commissioners focused on one goal: reasserting state sovereignty over federal lands.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened in Nevada is really just a symptom of a much larger problem,\u201d declared state representative Becky Lockhart. At the time, of course, Lockhart was merely Speaker of the Utah House; she had yet to launch her illustrious career in national politics. The manifesto that she and the other leaders agreed to, remembered in history as the Salt Lake Statement, is regarded today as one of the most important writings of the Abundance Revolution.\n\nIn the nation as a whole, the states\u2019 lack of sovereignty over their own territory had indeed been scandalous. In 2014, for example, the federal government owned 57 percent of Utah, 84 percent of Nevada, and 69 percent of Sarah Palin\u2019s Alaska. Indeed, Uncle Sam owned 47 percent of the land in the 11 Western states and about 28 of the total land of the US. Back in the 19th century, this federal ownership of land had begun innocently enough, for the simple reason that nobody else wanted the land; it had no economic value, unless it could be \u201creclaimed\u201d by federal irrigation efforts.\n\nYet beginning in the 1970s, the federal government\u2019s approach to land management changed dramatically. Whereas once Uncle Sam had supported development where possible, through dams and other kinds of infrastructure, the new federal policy was the opposite: The Greens, gaining control of federal policymaking during the 1970s, saw federal ownership of the land as an opportunity to stop any sort of development or economic growth.\n\nAnd a key tool for the Greens was the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. ESA represented a radical expansion of federal power: In the past, the national parks had been set aside to protect endangered species; yet after ESA was passed, the entire country became, in effect, a national park. As a result, in any location where activists could identify an \u201cendangered species,\u201d they could squelch development. And so enforcement of ESA became a kind of racket, in which clever biologists and litigators could team up to block any sort of development and take effective control of any land.\n\nYet as a reminder of the wisdom that power begets hubris and then nemesis, it was overreaching on the ESA\u2019s power that led to the Battle of Bunkerville; Bundy and other ranchers in Nevada were pushed off their land to protect the desert tortoise, a species that could easily have been protected\u2013if that were really the issue\u2013in zoos or nature preserves. But instead, the Greens got greedy, and that led to the moment when Bundy drew his famous Line in the Desert.\n\nThe repercussions in Nevada and nationwide were seismic in their long-run shock value. Most Nevadans, Westerners, and Americans came to see the folly of\u2013and the poverty of\u2013federal restrictiveness on resource development. As Kerry Picket, author of the classic history of that era, From Bunker Hill to Bunkerville: The Inside Story, observed later, \u201cEverything started to change the moment that Cliven stood up for himself, his land, and his way of life.\u201d Yes, great events came from small beginnings\u2013in this case, a tortoise. (Indeed, the Nevada tortoise population is doing fine; sound management enables four-leggers and two-leggers not only to coexist together, but also to flourish.)\n\nThe third triggering incident came on April 18, 2014, when the Barack Obama administration announced that it was delaying, yet again, any decision on the Keystone Pipeline. This move was widely regarded as cynical pandering to a sect of Green billionaires, led by the infamous Tom Steyer of San Francisco. The Obama administration and many Democrats seemed happy enough to bow to Steyer\u2019s wishes in return for campaign cash, but in this instance, the pandering was so flagrant that the decision blew up in the administration\u2019s face. While the liberal media were happy with the Keystone decision, the legacy press was no longer powerful enough to sway public opinion. Instead, the struggle for public opinion was swayed by activists who took to alternative and social media to make the case in favor of Keystone\u2013and against the Reign of Steyer.\n\nOne key activist of that era was Phil Kerpen, who launched an aggressive Twitter campaign, pounding away on the seeming corruption of the nexus of the Keystone decision and Green campaign contributions. As Wayne Allyn Root said many years later, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have spearheaded my investigation, let alone my presidential campaign, without Phil\u2019s muckraking.\u201d\n\nThe fourth triggering event was America\u2019s belated realization, during March and April 2014, that Russian leader Vladimir Putin was not a friend. The Obama administration had been notably slow to grasp the full implications of Putin\u2019s incursion into Crimea and eastern Ukraine, but the rest of the world could see the need for an urgent campaign of energy independence from Russia. And that\u2019s what happened: The 2016 presidential election, for example, is remembered as the Energy Election.\n\nSo in our review of the origins of the Abundance Revolution, we can cite three domestic events and one foreign event: first, the Battle of Bunkerville; second, the Salt Lake Statement; third, the Obama administration\u2019s last failed attempt to block the Keystone Pipeline; and fourth, the Russian incursion into Ukraine and the beginning of Cold War II.\n\nYet we must also note a larger trend, which had been building for decades prior to the events of April 2014. And that trend was the greater scientific and technical knowledge that led to a deeper understanding of how to exploit natural resources and use them for ever-accelerating wealth creation.\n\nWe might recall that a similar effort in the West against federal control, the \u201cSagebrush Rebellion\u201d of the late 1970s and early 1980s, had fired up and then fizzled. Looking back now at the Sagebrush Rebellion, we can see that the Rebels had the right idea, but the financial stakes were too low for them to succeed. That is, yes, there were timeless principles of a state\u2019s sovereignty and freedom at issue, but most Americans of the 1970s and 1980s didn\u2019t see that the issue of Western land was that big of a deal.\n\nThat lack of appreciation for the value of natural resources did not change, of course, until the fracking boom of the early 21st century. Once fracking started happening on a large scale, and once North Dakota grew to be one of the richest states in the union, people across the country began to realize that fracking could make them rich, too.\n\nStill, it took a while for the political system to absorb the idea that America could be truly rich. In 2009, for example, President Obama launched a \u201cstimulus\u201d program for the economy that completely ignored the idea of expanding energy production\u2013even as a study from the Congressional Research Service found that the US had the greatest energy resources of any country in the world; the study found that American possessed greater energy reserves than Saudi Arabia, China, and Canada combined.\n\nYet the Obama administration, focused on \u201cclimate change,\u201d chose to ignore this data; indeed, it did everything it could to oppose greater energy production. The administration instead pursued such nostrums as printing money through the \u201cquantitative easing\u201d monetary process.\n\nMeanwhile, during the Obama presidency, Americans could see that North Dakota wasn\u2019t unique in its energy abundance; it was simply early. News reports began to notice that huge reserves of energy were to be found all through the Midwest and Northeast, in California and everywhere offshore, everywhere, period.\n\nIn 2013, the Institute for Energy Research issued a report noting that the total value of oil and natural gas under federal lands and federal waters amounted to $128 trillion. In that era, $128 trillion was more than seven times the GDP of the US, more than 10 times the national debt held by the public, and more than 40 times annual federal revenues. A few observers took note of the report, suggesting policies to make use of that wealth, and yet most figures, in both parties, seemed not to notice the bonanza beneath their feet.\n\nWhy this lack of interest? Why this blindness to future gushers of wealth? Looking back to that hinge period, we can see that both major political parties were so heavily invested in their approach to economic and fiscal issues that they didn\u2019t want to see any change at all.\n\nThe Democrats, firmly in the grip of their Malthusian wing, were simply not interested in seeing more energy production. It took several election cycles for them to realize that the wealth of Steyer and his Green allies was, in fact, a poisoned chalice.\n\nThe Republicans, meanwhile, although receptive to the idea of greater energy production, were slow to fully champion the idea, because they were locked into their priority of cutting federal spending; it seemed that the Abundance Revolution was a threat to their idea of shrinking government. And so it took time for Republicans to realize that rapidly enriching the private sector was a better way to \u201cstarve the beast,\u201d at least on a relative basis, than the familiar frontal attack on entitlement spending. It was the prospect of tens of trillions in new wealth in the private sector that eventually motivated the GOP to embrace a truly comprehensive \u201call of the above\u201d energy strategy.\n\nIn addition, both parties contained a group of well-meaning centrists who worried about \u201cclimate change.\u201d Half a century later, the debate over whether climate change was happening back then has never been settled, but as we know, the climate-change issue was mooted by the Carbon Sequestration Revolution of the teens and twenties. And so we could freely burn not only natural gas and oil but also, in addition, coal\u2013and coal added many trillions more to national wealth.\n\nIn other words, technology once again changed the game: Today, when we think of carbon dioxide, we think of such wondrous carbon sinks as high-rises built of carbon nanotubes, thousand-yard-high \u201cAvatar Trees,\u201d and the new Carbon Islands archipelago in the Pacific, which now vies with the Hawaiian Islands as a resort destination.\n\nAt about the same time, in 2014, as the US was waking up to the crisis of scarcity, as well as the enticing prospect of energy abundance, Americans also began to realize that we faced other shortfalls, too.\n\nIn particular, we needed to secure our access to Rare Earth Elements (REE). For most of human history, such exotic REE as Lanthanum, Scandium, and Ytrrium were just mineral curiosities. Yet by the late 20th century, human ingenuity had found vital uses for REE in the new information economy. We found that it simply wasn\u2019t possible to run computer chips, lasers, batteries, and other advanced technology without REE.\n\nYet to our national consternation, we came to realize that the Greens had been drastically restricting domestic REE production, just as they had restricted domestic energy production. In both instances, vast wealth had been locked under federal lands, and not released until big pro-growth political change came to Washington, DC. Just as we didn\u2019t want our allies to be dependent on Russia for energy production, we didn\u2019t want ourselves to be dependent on China for REE.\n\nToday, America is not only exponentially richer than it was 50 years ago, it is also safer and more secure. Powered by cheap energy, we make things here at home, and we use our brains to keep finding more energy, more REE, and more wealth. We enjoy all the wonders that we once thought we could not afford, from first-rate infrastructure and generous old-age pensions to organ regeneration to minimal taxes\u2013even a budget surplus. We are protected by missile defense, even as adventurous Americans embark on deep-space travel.\n\nYes, it\u2019s been a great half-century for America, and we owe much of our good fortune to the bravery of Cliven Bundy."], ["http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/09/rubio-on-jihadists-we-will-look-for-you-we-will-find-you-and-we-will-kill-you/", "'We Will Look for You, We Will Kill You'", "GREENVILLE, South Carolina \u2013 GOP presidential candidate Sen.

Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

View Enlarged Image\n\nCorruption: The latest batch of IRS documents to be publicly released shows a government conspiring to criminalize political opposition. Did we learn about this from an inquisitive news outlet? Unfortunately, no.\n\nThanks to a band of lawyers called Judicial Watch, and no thanks at all to the mainstream press, we are learning about a shady October 2010 meeting between former IRS official Lois Lerner, Justice Department officials and the FBI. It was at this gathering of minds, says Judicial Watch, that the parties planned \"for the possible criminal prosecution of targeted nonprofit organizations for alleged illegal political activity.\"\n\nRecords unearthed by Judicial Watch also document the IRS transferring confidential tax returns from 113,000 nonprofit social welfare groups to the FBI \"as part of its prosecution effort.\"\n\nThey also show \"the Obama DOJ wanted IRS employees who were going to testify to Congress to turn over documents to the DOJ before giving them to Congress.\"\n\nThis scandal has come quite a way since it was first confirmed nearly 800 days ago that IRS was targeting for added scrutiny conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. Harassing conservative and Tea Party organizations and holding up their paperwork are one level of misconduct.\n\nBut planning to send people to prison because they have different political views seems criminal itself.\n\nIt's unlikely anyone in this government will be convicted and sentenced for meeting to talk about charging interest groups with crimes. But there remains the fact that while Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chaired the House Oversight Committee, he sent a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen telling him that Lerner might have violated federal tax law when she transmitted those tax returns to the Justice Department.\n\nAt the very least, we should see a proper investigation into this charge.\n\nMeanwhile, as Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says, these new documents \"show that the Obama IRS scandal is also an Obama DOJ and FBI scandal.\"\n\nFrom what Fitton has seen, he believes \"the FBI and Justice Department worked with Lois Lerner and the IRS to concoct some reason to put President Obama's opponents\" in prison before his re-election.\n\nWhat would we do without Judicial Watch and its Freedom of Information Act lawsuits?\n\nClearly, the media haven't been terribly curious about the scandal. But that's no surprise, since Obama has been their darling since early 2008 and they will do whatever is necessary to protect him, including looking the other way at scandals that might hurt him.\n\nThough the Republicans appear curious, we really haven't seen much from them despite their control of the House since 2011 and the Senate since January. Had the party roles been reversed, the Democrats would have turned Washington upside down long ago.\n\nWe don't truly expect anyone to spend time in a federal pen over any part of this growing scandal. Politics will override justice. But wouldn't it be nice if official Washington did its job for a change and at least made some people uncomfortable?"], ["http://www.wnd.com/2015/09/confederate-heroes-matter-banner-flown-over-richmond/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "\u2018Confederate heroes matter\u2019 banner flown over Richmond", "(Richmond Times-Dispatch) Community activists and historic preservationists got help from an unusual source to draw attention to their protest today of monuments to Confederate leaders on Monument Avenue during the first day of training for the UCI Road World Championships.\n\nA small plane carrying a banner with a Confederate battle flag and the phrase \u201cConfederate heroes matter\u201d circled above Monument Avenue, where the protest had gathered at the statue of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy.\n\nBut the drone of the aircraft did not drown the half-hour protest of the Richmond 2015 decision to make Monument Avenue a focal point of the world bicycle competition.\n\nconfederate_heroes_matter"], ["http://www.wnd.com/2015/09/super-blood-moon-odds-off-the-charts/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "\u2018Super blood moon\u2019 odds \u2018off the charts\u2019", "The grand finale of the rare blood-moon tetrad will be a spectacular \u201csupermoon\u201d eclipse, the first in more than three decades.\n\nAnd the scholar who discovered the correlation between a sequence of four blood moons and events in the history of the Jewish people thinks the extremely rare conclusion of the tetrad with a supermoon is a message from God to the nations of the world: Do not divide the land of Israel.\n\nPastor Mark Biltz of El Shaddai Ministries told WND the final blood moon of a series of four occurring on Jewish holy days in 2014 and 2015 is \u201ca loud call to Israel and to the nations.\u201d\n\nThe coming super blood moon will be seen in Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cThe land of Israel belongs to the God of Israel and is on lease to them. They have no authority to sell or give away the land of Israel to another people, as it is their heritage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fourth blood moon comes as the 70th United Nations General Assembly moves to recognize a Palestinian state, which Israel sees as a threat to its existence.\n\nBy a vote of 119 to 8, with 45 abstentions, the general assembly recently voted to allow the Palestinian Authority to raise the Palestinian flag in front of the United Nations. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations has invited hundreds of leaders to attend the flag-raising ceremony.\n\nBiltz, whose book \u201cBlood Moons: Decoding the Imminent Heavenly Signs\u201d examines the phenomenon and offers an interpretation, sees the move toward a Palestinian state in the Holy Land as an ominous development.\n\n\u201cThe prophet Joel warned Israel and the nations to not divide the land. This warning was even delivered within the context of \u2018blood moons\u2019 in chapters 2 and 3. Here we have the United Nations assuming they have the authority to divide the land of Israel. They will soon see that if they try, the Creator of the universe will step into human history in a most dramatic way.\u201d\n\nJoel 2:31 states, \u201cThe sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.\u201d\n\nBut is the appearance of a super \u201cblood moon\u201d at this time simply a natural occurrence?\n\nNoah Petro, deputy project scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, recently said, \u201cIt\u2019s just planetary dynamics.\u201d\n\nThe moon will appear larger than normal on the evening of Sept. 27-28, but as Petro explained: \u201cThere\u2019s no physical difference in the moon. It just appears slightly bigger in the sky. It\u2019s not dramatic, but it does look larger.\u201d\n\nBiltz sees no contradiction with the science.\n\n\u201cThe God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob uses the natural phenomena that He created to communicate to us,\u201d Biltz said.\n\nBiltz contends those who dismiss the final blood moon as merely a celestial curiosity are missing the point.\n\n\u201cWhile we know lunar eclipses are natural phenomena, it becomes supernatural when the statistics go off the charts by adding in other scientific data and human events. According to NASA, over 5,000 years we average only one total lunar eclipse every one and a half years. Here we have four total lunar eclipses within that same time period. The odds have just increased against it being a coincidence.\n\n\u201cNow you add the odds of having all four total lunar eclipses being in a row without any other eclipses in between and the odds increase even more. Now let\u2019s imagine the odds when you have four total lunar eclipses in a row, within a year and a half, and they fall on the biblical holidays of Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles! The odds are starting to go off the charts as this has only happened nine times in 2,000 years!\u201d\n\nBiltz also says it is impossible to ignore how these events seem to correlate with historic turning points for the Jewish people.\n\n\u201cYou can increase the odds even more by looking at the history of the last 500 years during the last three times this happened. The last three times this occurred were in 1967 when Israel when recaptured Jerusalem, when Israel became a nation and established itself in 1948 and 1949, and during the Spanish Inquisition in 1493 and 1494 when all the Jews were kicked out of Spain and Portugal,\u201d Biltz said.\n\n\u201cThis final blood moon is also occurring near the end of the seven-year Shemitah cycle. Many religious teachers, including New York Times bestselling author Jonathan Cahn, have predicted a \u201cgreat shaking\u201d will accompany this period, with possible fluctuations in the stock market and the American economy.\n\nBiltz suggests the final blood moon shares a relationship with the Shemitah cycle and believes the timing shows it isn\u2019t all just a coincidence.\n\n\u201cIf you still believe the blood moons tetrad has no special significance, you still have to explain the astronomical odds of having all this occur in the last year of the seven-year Shemitah cycle,\u201d said Biltz. \u201cKeep in mind, at this time all of Israel was supposed to be in Jerusalem to hear the King of Israel read from the Torah. With that context, think of the significance of a super moon, at this time, being seen in Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nBiltz maintains any fair minded person must admit the odds of all of these circumstances lining up is improbable. Furthermore, he insists, it is unprecedented in history.\n\n\u201cA super blood moon seen in Jerusalem, at the end of a Shemitah cycle, serving as the culmination of four total lunar eclipses in a row has never happened in history before,\u201d Biltz said.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this is all in line with what we read in Scripture. The Creator of the universe expressed His desire to communicate with us this way by having humans write down His thoughts. In Genesis 1:14, He declared the sun and the moon were created to send signals to us. And these signals are occurring on the feast days on His calendar.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances and events, he said, are \u201csupernatural.\u201d"], ["http://www.wnd.com/2015/09/obama-dubbed-most-powerful-enemy-of-helpless-babies/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Obama dubbed \u2018most powerful enemy\u2019 of helpless babies", "The House of Representatives passed two pro-life bills on Friday, one to freeze funding for Planned Parenthood pending a thorough investigation and the other to uphold the rights of babies who survive attempted abortions.\n\nThe House voted 241-187 to withhold funding for Planned Parenthood and passed the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act 248-177.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic day,\u201d said Rep.

Now they're in the unenviable position of trying to rejoin these babies by saying neither of them are persons and neither of them are worthy of protection.\"\n\nHe added, \"If Democrats and this president, their leader, can say we no longer protect born children because somehow they weren't wanted, I will tell you they have then made the statement that there is nothing that's wrong. There's nothing too far for them in terms of gaining short-term political gain if they have to sell out not only the country but future generations.\"\n\nFranks urges voters to pay attention to which lawmakers oppose mandating medical care for babies outside of the womb and make sure their next election is their last.\n\n\"If they vote against protecting a born-alive child, I am hoping the voters will send them packing for the remainder of their lives,\" he said. \"I think the American people at some point are going to say, 'That's enough. If you don't have the courage to protect a little child, then you've forgotten the whole purpose of government in the first place and we don't want you anywhere near the Capitol.\"\n\nHe said voters are the key to making sure government respects life.\n\n\"There's only two ways to change policy in this country,\" Franks said. \"That is either to elect the right people or beg the wrong ones to do the right thing.

But we are more afraid of the hypothetical gun-wielding psychopath than we are of eating fatty, sugary food.\n\nNew York state is great case study in this phenomenon (as well as a study in making controversial headlines). New York recently passed \u201ctough\u201d new gun control legislation, which includes more narrowly defining and restricting so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d in an effort to show the rest of us how it\u2019s done.

Total rifle homicides numbered just five. The \u201chands, fist, feet, etc.\u201d category, which includes pushing, numbered 26 homicides (NYC has also recently made headlines for subway pushing deaths). Knives were used in 160 homicides. The \u201cother weapons\u201d category numbered 143 homicides. Ban \u201cdangerous assault weapons\u201d (a subset of the rifles category)? Why? They numbered just five deaths.\n\nPerhaps because of the percentage of population that NYC comprises of the total state of New York, and perhaps also because of the tendency of crimes to increase in concentrated urban centers, NYC itself saw the majority of homicides in the state. In 2011, NYC saw 515 homicides out of the total 774 in the state. Three hundred-fourteen of these (61%) were from firearms, out of the 445 total firearm homicides statewide.\n\nContrasted with obesity deaths, NYC city alone has 5,800 of them a year. New York City Department of Health states 58% of NYC adults are overweight or obese, and nearly 40% of NYC\u2019s public school students are obese or overweight. Obesity among adults in NYC increased from 18% in 2002 to 23% in 2010.\n\n\u201c2011 Rifle homicides numbered just five for all of New York state\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York state Department of Health, state-wide obesity increased almost 40% from 2000 to 2010 to include almost a quarter (24.5%) of state residents. An estimated six out of every ten adult New Yorkers is overweight or obese. In 2010, over 5 million of adult New Yorkers were considered overweight, and over 3.5 million obese. The U.S. surgeon general reports that obese individuals (BMI > 30) have a 50%-100% increased risk of premature death from all causes, compared to individuals with a healthy weight, and \u201can estimated 300,000 deaths per year may be attributable to obesity.\u201d\n\n300,000.\n\nThat\u2019s a big number. Nationally, the FBI reports roughly 8,000-9,000 firearm homicides, of which 323 were from rifles in 2011. We are afraid of the wrong things.\n\nIn the gun control debate, we often hear \u201cif even one life can be saved, we have to try [to do something]\u201d (one could argue \u2013 convincingly \u2013 that such proponents would be willing to try anything regardless of how ineffective it has been proven to be).\n\nPresident Obama has used that statement at least twice \u2013 addressing Newtown and during a press conference announcing 23 executive orders. Vice President Joe Biden said: \u201cWe have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to diminish the prospect that anything like this could happen again.\u201d\n\nBut was New York\u2019s new gun control legislation that focused on so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d even necessary? Or was it political posturing that amounts to very little public benefit? NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a high profile gun control advocate (gun rights advocates would call him \u201canti-gun\u201d rights), even acknowledges, \u201cBanning these [military-style assault] weapons and ammunition does not mean there will never be another mass shooting.\u201d James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, says regarding crime reduction, \u201cThere is only so much air you can squeeze out of a balloon.\u201d\n\nThis means, of course, that is virtually impossible to completely change human morality 100% of the time. We work for gains where we can get them. But an expectation of no ill will or evil action \u2013 ever \u2013 is not a realistic expectation.\n\nIf we have a moral obligation to try to save a life, there is much more \u201cair in the balloon\u201d so to speak, in the obesity balloon than there is in the assault rifle balloon. Five deaths. Crime in NYC has been trending down for 40 years. By contrast, those 3.5 million obese New Yorkers are much more likely to die (a 50%-100% increased risk of premature death) from what they eat than a crazy lunatic with a gun.\n\nBanning sugary drinks is controversial, with many comparing the suggestion to \u201cnanny statism\u201d (\u201cWhat time should I go to bed? How big should my steaks be? \u2013 NYC councilman, Dan Halloran). However, according to many health experts, it would help to save lives. Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for food policy and obesity at Yale University stated \u201cYou don\u2019t feel as full when you consume calories in liquids. \u2026 These beverages are the single greatest source of added sugar in the American diet.\u201d Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health said \u201cSoda in large amounts is metabolically toxic. \u2026 It\u2019s obvious that this is the right thing to do.\u201d Is there a moral imperative to ban sugar drinks since doing so would save people from themselves (save a life)?\n\nAnd yet, for most of us, we are afraid more of the image on a news story of an AR-15 so-called \u201cassault rifle.\u201d This is not because the AR-15 is more likely to kill you. The truth is for many of us, what we choose to eat is more likely to kill us. The numbers in New York confirm this. The 300,000 that the surgeon general reports will die from obesity vs. the FBI Uniform Crime Report data of 12,664 homicides (just 8,583 from guns) confirms that. We\u2019re afraid of the wrong things.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Jan 22, 2013.

Apparently this follows a pattern of refusals to cooperate that go back as far as the original inspector general investigation back in the early summer.\n\nPagliano had worked with Clinton going back to at least 2006, serving on her original presidential campaign then later at the State Department with continuing duties overseeing the email server. Last week Clinton claimed to have used the secret private email server going back at least to her time as senator from New York:\n\n\u201cI did all my business on my personal email [in the Senate],\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI was not thinking a lot when I got in [to the State Department].

I didn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be.\u201d \u201cThis was fully above board, people knew I was using a personal email, I did it for convenience. I sent emails that I thought were work related to people\u2019s dot gov accounts,\u201d she added.\n\nThis last statement is a direct contradiction to evidence previously revealed that showed that Clinton and her aides had sent information that would later be determined to be classified to at least six other people\u2019s private email addresses, including non-government employee Sidney Blumenthal, the longtime ClintonWorld loyalist who was blocked from taking a position at State by the Obama Administration due to rumors he had spread about President Obama during the 2008 campaign.\n\nAs the Baltimore Sun said today \u201cThere is a smoking gun. In fact, there\u2019s a whole smoking arsenal\u201d.\n\n[Fox News][Yahoo News][NBC News][Baltimore Sun][Photo Credit: The Daily Signal]"], ["http://freebeacon.com/culture/the-bible-and-its-translators/", "The Bible and its Translators", "BY:\n\n\n\nWhen Aviya Kushner enrolled in Marilynne Robinson\u2019s Old Testament course at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, she didn\u2019t recognize the text her teacher and classmates were familiar with. She wasn\u2019t new to the stories they were studying; she had read them many times since she was a young child. But Kushner had read them in Hebrew as part of her Orthodox Jewish schooling, and the translations her Christian classmates knew well sounded nothing like the Hebrew to Kushner. With Robinson\u2019s encouragement, Kushner set out to collect a wide variety of English translations, then compare them with each other and with the Hebrew Bible.\n\nIn The Grammar of God, Kushner draws on this research to explore how the Bible in English translation differs from the Masoretic Text. Interspersed throughout are meditations on Kushner\u2019s family and schooling, some relevant to the Bible and some not so much\u2014for example, when Kushner tries to connect an anecdote about a vendor urging customers to buy two doughnuts to a phrase that appears twice in the account of the third day of Creation. Kushner touches on differences between traditional Jewish methods of interpretation and the way her Christian classmates and professor approached the Old Testament.\n\nThese divergent methods account for a great deal of misunderstanding of how Judaism relates to the Hebrew Bible. Kushner explains that Jews have traditionally read the Masoretic Text on a page crammed with commentaries that offer conflicting explanations of the holy words. These commentaries are guided by the rabbinic principles of exegesis, among them a rule that states that the order of events in the text need not be chronological; one commentator may hold that one event immediately follows another, while other commentators could say that an event from another part of the Bible came between them or that the order of events was reversed. The result is that Jewish readings treat the text as ambiguous and capable of conveying multiple meanings simultaneously. Kushner speculates that Christian reading styles might have grown to accommodate more ambiguity had the Geneva Bible with its marginal commentary not supplanted the King James or Authorized Edition of 1611.\n\nAlso important is the Oral Law, the body of Jewish legal literature that interprets the Masoretic Text and that frequently softens the harsher aspects of the legal code found in the Pentateuch. Kushner points out that Christian depictions of a wrathful Old Testament deity can be puzzling to Jews like her who see the Hebrew Bible through the lens of the Oral Law. Many an unfruitful interreligious debate might be improved if participants understood these differences. Anyone who\u2019s been tempted to say, \u201cBut what about \u2026\u201d before citing some verse to an adherent of another Abrahamic faith should read The Grammar of God to see how different traditions arrive at disparate readings of common texts and stories.\n\nRegardless of the reader\u2019s worldview, Hebrew feels different from English. Thanks to prefixes and suffixes that pack information about person and tense into each word, Hebrew verses are shorter than English ones. A few standard suffixes create many instances of rhyme that cannot be replicated in the English. Repeated words and intensifiers add degrees of emphasis that are difficult to translate. And the meanings behind the names of Biblical figures are apparent at a glance to readers of the Hebrew; English readers, by contrast, see no relationship between \u201cAdam\u201d and \u201cearth\u201d or \u201cIsaac\u201d and \u201claughter\u201d without the help of a footnote. Reading these passages in The Grammar of God is probably as close as an English speaker can get to appreciating the sound of Hebrew without learning the language.\n\nIt is a bit disappointing that, despite her obvious sensitivity to language, Kushner stumbles when she criticizes certain choices made by the King James translators. For instance, she finds it outrageous that the noun p\u0304\u0101\u00b7re\u1e35 in Exodus 1:13 is translated as \u201crigour;\u201d Kushner claims that this translation makes slavery in Egypt sound sanitized and \u201cmanageable\u201d and prefers to render the word as \u201cbreaking labor.\u201d But the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s definitions for \u201crigour\u201d include \u201charshness,\u201d \u201cseverity,\u201d and \u201ccruelty,\u201d and its example sentences show that the word held those meanings in the early 17th century, when the Authorized Edition was being prepared. While Kushner is correct that the three-letter root of p\u0304\u0101\u00b7re\u1e35 means \u201cto break,\u201d translating p\u0304\u0101\u00b7re\u1e35 as \u201ccruelty\u201d is not far fetched. If \u201crigour\u201d suggests standardized testing rather than slavery for contemporary readers, it is not Lancelot Andrewes\u2019 fault.\n\nKushner also objects to the translation of Psalm 42:3, which in the King James Bible begins, \u201cMy tears have been my meat day and night,\u201d and she asserts that \u201cmy meat\u201d would have been the correct translation of b\u0259-\u015b\u0101-r\u00ee, a Hebrew word meaning \u201cmy flesh\u201d that does not appear in this verse. But Kushner quotes with favor the medieval Jewish grammarian Ibn Janach, who defined le-\u1e25em, the noun used here, which literally means \u201cbread,\u201d as \u201csustenance.\u201d And the Oxford English Dictionary gives this definition for \u201cmeat\u201d: \u201cFood, as nourishment for people[\u2026] esp. solid food, as opposed to drink\u201d and shows that it was used in this way around the turn of the 16th century. Kushner favors the translation \u201cbread\u201d over \u201csustenance\u201d because it has the advantage of prompting the reader to recall other relevant verses that mention bread. This is reasonable, but her complaint against the King James translators, who did not distort the meaning of the text any more than Ibn Janach did, is not.\n\nAt times Kushner attempts to infer the meaning of biblical Hebrew words from their Modern Hebrew counterparts, despite protests from her linguist mother, which she relays to us here. (The connection between biblical and Modern Hebrew vocabulary can be tenuous because ancient words are recruited to represent new phenomena; for example, \u1e25a\u0161-mal, the Modern Hebrew word for \u201celectricity,\u201d appears in Ezekiel 1:4, where it is often translated as \u201cmetal\u201d or \u201camber.\u201d) Kushner notes that the root of the verb way\u00b7yiz\u00b7\u2019\u0101\u00b7q\u016b, which the King James Bible translates as \u201ccried\u201d in Exodus 2:23, is also the root of the Modern Hebrew word for \u201csiren,\u201d and she reflects on the siren that sounds on Israel\u2019s two national memorial days. Kushner understands that the sound mentioned in Exodus was not really a siren, but her emphasis on Modern Hebrew could mislead readers into thinking that the verb in this verse has something to do with mourning or bereavement, when in fact it indicates a cry for help. Kushner even refers to the Israelites\u2019 \u201csiren cries,\u201d which calls to mind Odysseus with his ears full of beeswax, a grossly inappropriate image in the context of Exodus 2.\n\nFor some, these missteps will make The Grammar of God a frustrating read. Those who can overlook them will enjoy Kushner\u2019s discussions of traditional Jewish scriptural interpretation and the experience of reading Hebrew. If the book motivates them to seek out more authoritative works on Hebrew translation, it will have served a worthy purpose."], ["http://freebeacon.com/culture/the-bitter-cup/", "Washington Free Beacon", "BY:\n\n\n\nAgatha Christie was the instigator. More specifically, it was the TV adaptation of Triangle at Rhodes, a Hercule Poirot mystery that combined the aspirational attractions of leisure on the Mediterranean, intrigue under parasols, and murder in evening dress. The center of the titular love triangle, when exhausted from lounging too long strenuous under hats too enormous, asks the waiter or admirer at hand to be a lamb and fetch her a pink gin. One night, her devoted husband waltzes across the hotel parquet with said cocktail. She downs it, she gasps, she clutches her bejeweled turban with a begloved hand\u2014and voila, murder most foul.\n\nWhile it would give me great pleasure to report that the pink gin was invented and championed by wealthy poisoners in foreign resorts, credit must go to the British Navy. Angostura bitters are said to have turned one\u2019s daily ration of Plymouth gin into a cure for seasickness, and, the story goes, officers brought the drink from the outposts of empire to the English bar. Now, you can (theoretically) order it chilled or at room temperature, on the rocks or in a coupe, with bitters stirred in or swirled and discarded as a rinse. But I knew that I wanted my gin exactly as I\u2019d seen it fall from Mrs. Chantry\u2019s nerveless fingers: served up, in a little cocktail glass, mixed with enough bitters to give it the color of deep pink-tinted rust.\n\nDrinks have aesthetic profiles that, in conjunction with the primary factors of smell and taste, help determine what we want in a particular mood, or season, or social context. Once, I joked that someone should invent a scotch that looks like a cosmo; a pink gin fills the need behind the joke, without doing criminal violence to honest whisky.\n\nDelicate, colorful, and floral; simple, bracing, and gin-forward, it is the perfect summer drink. Luckily for those in whom earthly joys might dull the pain of mortal blight and turn their eyes from heaven\u2019s promise, it is nearly impossible to order.\n\nMy friend warned me when I first embarked on my quest. She had asked for a pink gin at several New York bars.\n\n\u201cOrder something else,\u201d the bartender would bark, as he stirred organic mandrake root for a gin cocktail containing three different types of champagne. She ordered something else.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, B\u2014\u2014,\u201d I said, patting her hand, \u201cyou are naively fixated on the name \u2018pink gin\u2019? After all, it has only two ingredients, and can hardly be difficult to make. The bartenders are intimidated by a drink they do not recognize, but by listing the parts without attaching a moniker, we shall evade their little qualms. \u2018Be ye wise as serpents, et cetera.\u2019\u201d\n\nThus it was with the swagger of cunning and confidence that I strolled into the neighborhood\u2019s ritzy cocktail bar, where the town\u2019s wealthy and divorced smile at each other under soft lighting.\n\n\u201cPlymouth gin and angostura bitters, please.\u201d Watch and learn, my sweet B\u2014\u2014, how to obtain the drink that dare not speak its name.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have Plymouth.\u201d This I had not anticipated. But, like any covert operative worth her salt, I improvised. Hendrick\u2019s was the sweetest and most floral substitute I could think of on the spot.\n\n\u201cYou want it on the rocks?\u201d\n\nI was still flustered from the Hendrick\u2019s crisis, and had furthermore neglected to consider the particulars of how I wanted my undercover pink gin served. I decided to improvise further. This, in retrospect, was hubris, and punished accordingly.\n\n\u201cNo ice, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want it in a rocks glass, no ice?\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, could I have it up?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you do want ice?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014no\u2014I mean\u2014I just want it in the glass martinis come in.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you want a Hendrick\u2019s martini?\u201d\n\nMy voiced dropped a few decibels. The bar\u2019s patrons, though scant, were now watching with interest.\n\n\u201cNo, I want gin and Angostura bitters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I want it\u2014\u201d\n\nShe turned from the screen into which she punched her orders, and put down her shaker.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start again and tell me slowly, clearly, exactly what you want.\u201d Her voice was calm, and only a tad too friendly.\n\nI took a deep breath, and, without stopping for another, choked out the details of my order.\n\n\u201cSo you want a gin martini stirred, bitters instead of vermouth.\u201d\n\nI had meant to smuggle the cocktail into the lexicon of local mixology with an airy \u201cOh, this? This is a pink gin,\u201d not to pass it off as a debased martini. But I was a broken woman, and jumped at any cessation of hostilities, however shameful the terms.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. I paid for it and slunk away without making eye contact again.\n\nFor unrelated reasons, when next visiting my comrade-in-gin, I suggested that we make the drink ourselves. Gin aplenty we already had, and cocktail glasses\u2014lovely, fragile little curiosities\u2014we found at a thrift store, but no Angostura bitters. The local liquor store did not carry them, and the proprietor seemed faintly, though courteously, puzzled by our request. Perhaps under some ancient Blue laws bitters had been outlawed on the grounds that they rendered the call of strong liquor a bit too musical.\n\nHowever, this proved untrue the next afternoon, when we trekked across town to the wine store. As I had only threatened to faint from heat exhaustion four or five times on the way over, the rows of bitters lining the shelves beneath seemed to be virtue\u2019s just reward. There were Aztec Chocolate bitters, celery bitters, every type and disgusting subtype of bitters imaginable\u2014except Angostura. There was an alleged Angostura substitute, but in a drink with only two ingredients substitution felt like defeat. Besides, we did not trust the quaintly labeled bottle or its peddlers. The shop had lured us in with the promise of simple, sensible drinks for simple, sensible people; but in its bosom nursed the viper of faddishness.\n\nOur only option left was the pub, and the nearest available was not the type where two customers asking for a glass of bitters might pass as one of the day\u2019s many charming oddities. It was a sports bar, haunted by fraternity brothers, businessmen in salmon shorts, and other harbingers of misery. Forty-eight hours of failure, though, had lent our eyes a frantic gleam, and like two gunslingers bent on vengeance, we received a wide berth as we made our way through the saloon.\n\n\u201cCan you give us some Angostura bitters, ma\u2019am?\u201d I drawled, adjusting an invisible ten-gallon hat. Out of female solidarity I refrained from calling her \u201clittle lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust bitters?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to buy a bottle.\u201d\n\nShe cocked a crushing eyebrow, and I was a poor cowpoke a long way from home.\n\nIn the end it was the forces of law and order, not the bartender\u2019s skepticism, that defeated us. Selling alcoholic drinks for takeaway consumption was prohibited in bars, and in vain did we point out that we had come on foot and were as sober as the grave. We returned home to lick our wounds and sip mournful gin-and-limes. The wanton destruction of one\u2019s cherished hopes is no reason to invite scurvy.\n\nSuccess, like bitters, often materializes once you stop looking for it.

The prison break is the second in Mexico for Guzman, who fled a different maximum-security facility in 2001.\n\nEl Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa cartel is reportedly the source of much of the heroin trafficked into the United States.\n\nYahoo News asked Riley whether or not Trump\u2019s presidential campaign promise to build a wall along the Southwest border would make a difference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for anything that would make a difference in stopping criminals and the flow of drugs. I\u2019m a cop. Whatever the policymakers decide, I\u2019ll work with,\u201d responded Riley, signaling support for Trump\u2019s immigration proposal.\n\nWhen asked if the U.S. government was doing enough to stem illegal cross-border activity, Riley said, \u201cWhen you look at the relationships between street gangs and these people \u2014 wow. And then you throw in the supply of illegal guns, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nYahoo News noted that Riley recently told U.S. lawmakers that heroin seizures along the Southwest border had more than doubled in the last five years. The DEA official also said that the loads of heroin pouring into the U.S. had increased significantly.\n\nYahoo News asked Riley to discuss how the heroin is getting into the U.S.\n\n\u2018Virtually anyway you can imagine \u2014 from an 18-wheeler to inside a gas tank on a mobile home to a guy doing a backstroke in the Rio Grande with a backpack,\u201d responded the DEA\u2019s No. 2. Sinaloa probably has the best financed research and development of any so-called corporation in the world. Whatever they come up with, they\u2019re going to try.\u201d\n\nIn his immigration reform plan, Trump proposes building a wall along the Southwest border and having Mexico pay for it. He also vows to deport illegal immigrant gang members.\n\nTrump is the leading presidential candidate of the Republican party. Critics of Trump\u2019s border wall proposal argue that it will be ineffective and too costly to build and maintain.\n\nThe DEA is a component of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)."], ["http://2ndamendmentfight.com/mass-shootings-are-responsible-for-less-than-100-out-of-12000-annual-homicides-in-the-u-s/", "Mass Shootings Are Responsible For Less than 100 Out of 12,000 Annual Homicides in the U.S.", "Massive media publicity over mass shootings in the last year have brought gun control back to the forefront in the U.S. Banning so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d and \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are all the rage. Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

In his statement he said:\n\n\u201cWe support the verbatim inclusion of the sustainable development goals and targets as in the Report of the OWG (Open Working Group).\u201d (emphasis added) Toward the end of the statement, the Archbishop added, \u201cWe would strongly encourage the use and coordination of all sources of financing to achieve the SDGs and development in general.\u201d\n\nThe Lepanto Institute, in coordination with several other organizations, has reached out to Archbishop Auza for clarification. After a week, there has been no response. The Vatican \u2018s new nuncio to the UN may not realize that the SDGs as written will most definitely lead to an expansion of abortion and contraception promotion in the developing world, however the Archbishop\u2019s statement will make it easier for the UN to implement this program according to its own agenda.\n\nArchbishop Auza\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t merely provide support for the Sustainable Development Goals , it\u2019s an endorsement of every single word of the SDGs in their current written form! And written very clearly into the Sustainable Development Goals, in the very report referenced by Archbishop Auza, is the inclusion of \u201csexual and reproductive rights,\u201d \u201csexual and reproductive health services,\u201d and \u201cfamily planning services.\u201d Here is what the Zero Draft report of the Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals says.\n\nParagraph 23, under the heading \u201cThe New Agenda\u201d:\n\n\u201cTo extend life expectancy for all, we must achieve universal health No one must be left behind. We commit to accelerating the progress made to date in reducing infant, child and maternal mortality by ending all preventable deaths of infants, children and expectant mothers by 2030. We shall ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, including for family planning, information and education. We will equally accelerate the pace of progress made in fighting malaria, HIVIAIDS, tuberculosis and other communicable diseases and epidemics. At the same time we shall devote greater effort to tackling non-communicable diseases.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\n\u201cUniversal access\u201d means access without any form of regulation or restriction. The word \u201cservices\u201d is not to be equated with \u201cpractices,\u201d such as natural family planning. In other words, the \u201cnew agenda\u201d means the provision of the full range of contraceptive drugs and devices, including abortifacients, without restriction. The \u201cinformation and education\u201d portion means the dissemination of sexually-explicit, contraception-promoting literature and programs intended to indoctrinate men, women and children in the use of all forms of contraception.\n\nGoal Three of the Sustainable Development Goals, according to the Zero Draft report, had the noble-sounding objective of \u201cEnsuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages.\u201d However, one of the objectives listed for achieving this goal is, \u201cBy 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, infonnation (sic) and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.\u201d\n\nGoal five is even worse. The stated goal is to \u201cachieve gender equality and empower all women and girls,\u201d and the last listed objective under this goal is to \u201censure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action.\u201d\n\nThe key to understanding this is knowing what was agreed upon in the \u201cProgramme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development\u201d and the \u201cBeijing Platform for Action.\u201d Bear in mind that the Archbishop representing Pope Francis at the United Nations said that \u201cWe support the verbatim inclusion of the sustainable development goals and targets as in the Report of the OWG.\u201d\n\nThe Programme of Action adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development makes abundantly clear that \u201creproductive health\u201d means all forms of contraception and \u201csafe, legal abortions.\u201d Paragraph 7.6 defined what is meant by reproductive health, indicating that in addition to the provision of \u201cfamily planning services\u201d and sex education, reproductive health also means providing referrals for \u201cfamily planning services.\u201d It also says that reproductive health includes abortion, as specified in paragraph 8.25.\n\nParagraph 8.25 is quite clear. While abortion is not to be suggested as a form of \u201cfamily planning,\u201d it specifies that expanded access to family planning services must be given the highest priority in preventing \u201cunwanted pregnancies.\u201d Furthermore, this section does not prohibit abortion as an action of \u201csexual and reproductive health,\u201d saying that \u201cin circumstances where abortion is not against the law, such abortions should be safe.\u201d\n\nAll of this goes back to the Sustainable Development Goals with regard to the definition of \u201creproductive health.\u201d There can be no doubt that the terms \u201csexual and reproductive health\u201dmean the full range of contraceptives including abortifacients, and safe abortions. The Zero Draft of the Sustainable Development Goals also indicated that the Beijing Platform for Action is another document helping to define reproductive health. Paragraph 94 of the Beijing Platform for Action reads like a Planned Parenthood brochure:\n\n94. Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so . Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods of their choice for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. In line with the above definition of reproductive health, reproductive health care is defined as the constellation of methods, techniques and services that contribute to reproductive health and well-being by preventing and solving reproductive health problems. It also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relations, and not merely counselling and care related to reproduction and sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the eve of the promulgation of Pope Francis\u2019 new encyclical, Laudate Si, The Lepanto Institute published an analysis of the genesis of the encyclical itself. In that analysis, we expressed deep concerns because a document published by the UNFPA (United Nation\u2019s Population Fund) indicated that in relation to the new encyclical, Pope Francis had thrown the full weight of the Catholic Church behind the Sustainable Development Goals. Once the encyclical was published, it was clear that paragraph 169 of Laudate Si gave an endorsement of the SDGs, and at the promulgation ceremony itself, Dr. Carolyn Woo, president of Catholic Relief Services actively pushed the SDGs in her speech.\n\nVery clearly, the prediction made by the Lepanto Institute is indeed being fulfilled. The scary thing is that the Vatican\u2019s support for the Sustainable Development Goals is unqualified and includes the UN\u2019s language that indicates contraception as a form of population control.\n\nThe Apostolic Nuncio and Permanent Observer of the Holy See at the United Nations, Archbishop Bernardito Auza gave complete, unreserved, and unrestricted support and endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals AS WRITTEN. He said, \u201cWe support the verbatim inclusion of the sustainable development goals and targets as in the Report of the OWG.\u201d As it has been demonstrated, the Sustainable Development Goals, as written, include unrestricted access to the full range of contraception, including abortifacients, and \u201csafe abortion.\u201d\n\nThere are only four possibilities regarding this situation:\n\nEither he didn\u2019t read the full document, and accepted someone\u2019s summary of it He was handed a document OTHER than the one published on the web He doesn\u2019t know how \u201creproductive health\u201d is defined by the UN documents cited, or (God Forbid!) the Archbishop believes it is important to adopt all aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals, including access to contraception and \u201csafe abortion.\u201d\n\nWe have no reason to believe that possibility number four is the case. However, whatever the reason for the statement, it is clear that such a strong statement of support will strengthen and embolden the population control agenda of the United Nations through the Sustainable Development Goals. The simple solution would be for the Vatican to make its support of the SDGs contingent upon the exclusion of abortion and contraception, both in act and in promotion. In fact, a stronger statement would be for the Vatican to announce that it will actively oppose the Sustainable Development Goals should contraception or abortion have ANY place in them whatsoever.\n\nWe must all pray and fast for Archbishop Auza and for Pope Francis.\n\nIn the mean time, contact the Archbishop and respectfully and urgently ask him not to support the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nTel: (212) 370-7885\n\noffice@holyseemission.org"], ["http://thepatriotfactor.blogspot.com/2015/08/op-ed-nothing-to-see-here-folks-by.html", "The Patriot Factor", "The Patriot Factor Diane Sori I\u2019m an American Patriot who refuses to let our beloved country be changed into something unrecognizable to us by a man who wants to radically change and destroy our America and take away our children\u2019s future.

It was more like Darkness at Noon. Jeb Bush did call for the party to embrace a Reaganesque sense of optimism, which he contrasted with \u201cthe Donald Trump approach of \u2018Everything is bad, everything is coming to an end.\u201d But with occasional exceptions, usually involving the softer-edged John Kasich, the Trump approach dominated. For five hours, the candidates stood in front of Reagan\u2019s plane and described America as a declining nation in a dystopic world, as they pledged, to borrow a phrase, to Make America Great Again.\n\nThe big question of 2016 could well be whether Americans agree with the Republican portrait of Obama-era malaise. It was taken for granted last night that the national debt is out of control, the economy is deteriorating, the government is corrupt, and the world, as Lindsey Graham put it, is \u201con fire.\u201d Rubio complained that \u201cour left-wing government is undermining all the institutions that support the family.\u201d Ted Cruz declared that the Iran nuclear deal would turn the Obama administration into the world\u2019s largest financier of Islamic terror. Chris Christie said the middle class \u201cis getting plowed over by Barack Obama.\u201d The one thing the Republicans didn\u2019t seem too concerned about was climate change, which they agreed was not a problem worthy of solutions that might increase utility bills at a time when average Americans, as Rick Santorum put it, \u201care losing ground.\u201d\n\nObama provided an alternative view yesterday before the debate, making the case before the Business Roundtable that \u201cAmerica\u2019s great right now.\u201d He later tweeted some supporting evidence that wasn\u2019t mentioned last night on CNN: U.S. businesses have added 13 million jobs over 66 straight months of employment growth, with the jobless rate dropping from 10% to 5%. The budget deficit has fallen from nearly 10% of GDP to less than 3% under Obama, while the uninsured rate has fallen from 15.4% to 9.2% under Obamacare. The U.S. auto industry, on the brink of extinction before Obama\u2019s bailout, is on pace for its best year since 2001.\n\nBut last night wasn\u2019t really about evidence, although several candidates did mention that wages are stagnant, and Bush noted the \u201clabor participation rate\u201d has been declining since 1977. There was a consensus on stage that illegal immigration is a national crisis\u2014an \u201cincredible problem,\u201d said Ben Carson\u2014even though the population of undocumented immigration has actually declined by about 1 million under Obama. Carson also bemoaned how little has been done to push oil independence; in fact, oil imports from the Middle East just hit a 28-year low. Listening to Graham, Rubio and Fiorina decrying the weakness of the military and the need for a much larger navy, a listener never would have guessed that the U.S. spends five times as much as any other country on defense.\n\nThere was some debate about the Iraq War, and Trump mentioned the financial cataclysm of 2008, but some of the candidates openly pined for the good old days of George W. Bush. It wasn\u2019t just Jeb who credited his brother with keeping the country safe; Christie added that Obama had stripped away that safety, even though the September 11 attacks were on Bush\u2019s watch, and nothing similar has happened since.

So, we are narrowing and focusing\" the choices.\n\nThe narrowing of choices is likely to mean that some consumers who already had their existing health plans canceled could now be forced by their new plans to change doctors, dashing a second promise President Obama made while selling the public on Obamacare three years ago.\n\nObama already apologized to millions of Americans whose existing plans were canceled despite the president's pledge that \"if you like the plan you have, you can keep it.\" But the president also repeatedly promised consumers that \u201cif you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period.\"\n\nCigna Health Insurance executives have acknowledged that they would be limiting the choices offered to consumers. That kind of shift in the industry means that a policy bought on Obamacare's insurance exchanges likely would provide far fewer choices than employer-sponsored plans do now.\n\nThe limiting of choices also could require consumers in less populous states to drive further for in-network medical attention than they do now.\n\n\"In New Hampshire, the health care law cuts out 10 of the 26 hospitals in the state,\" said Betsy McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York and an Obamacare critic.\n\nIn California, many top hospitals, including Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, will not participate in most exchange plans.\n\n\"Only a select few plans will provide full coverage for care from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and our physicians,\" the hospital announced to patients on its website.\n\nThe exchanges will mostly steer clear of many of the nation's top academic hospitals because those providers tend to provide more extensive and expensive care, industry officials said. Insurers also are likely to include in their networks the doctors they deem the most cost effective.\n\nThe Medical Group Management Association in September surveyed nearly 48,000 physicians about the health care exchanges and found that less than 30 percent of those doctors planned to participate in the exchanges. Another 40 percent said they would consider joining an exchange, the survey showed.\n\nNearly 60 percent of the doctors who decided not to participate in the exchanges said they ruled it out because they feared that low reimbursement rates from exchange-purchased insurance plans would threaten their practices.\n\n\"Cost is a huge factor,\" Anders M. Gilberg, a lobbyist with MGMA. \"The plans have made no secret of the fact that the way they are offering lower premiums to patients and benefit options on the exchanges is either by reducing reimbursement rates to physicians or narrowing the networks or controlling the number of physicians. They are contracting with fewer physicians and the reimbursement rates are lower relative to plans outside the exchanges.\"\n\nThe reimbursement rates on exchange-purchased plans will vary, but they are expected to parallel rates now paid to doctors under Medicaid (86 cents per $1) and Medicare (91 cents per $1).\n\nMcCaughey said Obamacare will operate much like Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs, operate now. Under that model, consumers often must choose between lower premiums or greater choice of providers. To keep costs \u2014 and premiums \u2014 low, insurers impose restrictions like shorter hospital stays and fewer choices of doctors.\n\nThe new health care law, McCaughey said, \"was designed to ensure continuity of care for lower income people.\""], ["http://rebootingliberty.com/appeals-court-strikes-down-parts-of-d-c-gun-registration-requirements/", "Appeals court strikes down parts of D.C. gun registration requirements", "The Bible and its Translators >>Source: Washington Free Beacon >> >>By Sarah Brodsky >> When Aviya Kushner enrolled in Marilynne Robinson\u2019s Old Testament course at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, she didn\u2019t recognize the text her te\u2026 Read more\n\nThe 4 Types of Poverty, and How to Cure Them >>Source: The Daily Signal >> >>By Robert L.

Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

In a 128-page draft law produced by the German Interior Ministry and obtained by The Washington Post, the government would speed asylum procedures, cut cash benefits, hasten deportations and punish those with false claims and phony paperwork. The tough new measures, the draft bill states, are needed to cope with the huge influx of refugees into Germany, where 800,000 asylum applications were expected this year in a country with a population of 81 million. In Croatia, meanwhile, leaders reversed themselves a day after they promised to greet asylum seekers with open arms \u2014 a greeting that stood in sharp contrast to a decision by neighboring Hungary to seal its frontier with razor wire and riot police. Croatia\u2019s decision to close roads crossing into Serbia raised the risk of pushing asylum seekers into the area\u2019s fields and forests, which are littered with land mines from the Balkans wars in the 1990s. The crush of refugees and migrants has shocked European leaders even as they struggle to find a common strategy to deal with their biggest humanitarian crisis in decades.\n\nHere\u2019s an idea for a strategy:\n\n1. Perimeter defense: Keep the uninvited out of Europe and out of the EU\n\n2. Defense in depth\n\nThe proposed German law would provide food and a ticket to return to the first European Union country the asylum seeker entered, instead of housing and cash benefits. That could mean far fewer people would win protection in Germany or elsewhere in Europe, since countries such as Hungary are generally declining to award refugee status. In addition, asylum seekers deemed to be withholding vital information \u2014 such as their passports or proof of their country of origin \u2014 would be denied benefits. Asylum seekers also would need to remain in crowded reception centers for six months, rather than three, before earning the right to subsidized housing. Those who failed to comply with orders to leave Germany could be subject to forced removal without advance notice. It was unclear whether the proposed German law, which must be approved by Parliament before it can take effect, would continue to make exceptions for Syrians fleeing civil war. \u201cThis draft counteracts the new German welcome culture,\u201d said Karl Kopp, spokesman for the pro-refugee organization ProAsyl. \u201cIt contains a toughness and populism that is not acceptable.\u201d In announcing the closure of most roads into Serbia until further notice, the Croatian Interior Ministry said late Thursday that it took the step after more than 11,000 people arrived in a 24-hour period. \u201cDon\u2019t come anymore here. Our capacities are full,\u201d Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said earlier in English near his nation\u2019s border with Serbia. \u201cIf you want to save your life, please go to reception centers in Serbia or Macedonia or Greece. \u201cAnyone who is sending a message that this is an open door for the European Union, and that they can go to Germany and Slovenia . . . it\u2019s a lie,\u201d he said. Croatia\u2019s president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, asked her nation\u2019s military to be ready to defend the border if necessary. Croatia\u2019s reversal came after hundreds of asylum seekers scuffled with Croatian riot police at the Tovarnik rail station near the Serbian border after waiting for hours in the late-summer heat with little food and water. \u2026 On Thursday, one of the officials who helped spark the onslaught resigned. Germany\u2019s top migration official, Manfred Schmidt, stepped down for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d less than a month after his agency posted a message on Twitter that had far-reaching consequences. The announcement that Germany would no longer deport Syrian asylum seekers to the E.U. country they entered \u2014 often Greece or Italy \u2014 helped fuel fresh waves of refugees who saw Germany as opening its arms. With Europe bitterly divided, bigger and richer countries are increasingly lashing out at poorer partners that have refused to take in many people. \u201cGermany is helping. The question is, who is helping Germany?\u201d German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel asked in a video released Thursday.\n\nYou know, Germany, you are supposed to be in a Union with other Europeans. If you choose to betray Europeans for the denizens of other continents, it\u2019s a little rich to act like you are upholding European unity.\n\nHe accused other countries of taking E.U. money, then \u201chiding in the bushes when they have to take responsibility.\u201d Hungary has so far taken the harshest measures to block the refugee tide, using tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons Wednesday to repel a crowd of migrants who threw stones and debris at police along the border fence. [Europe asks: Why no mention of refu\u00adgee crisis in GOP debate?] \u201cWe don\u2019t like the fence,\u201d the Hungarian government\u2019s chief spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, said Thursday. \u201cBut it seems to be working to protect the country\u2019s borders, to stop illegal migration. Obviously, we are going to continue with that: keeping the fence, protecting the fence by police.\u201d \u2026 Hungarian authorities said the number of people crossing into their nation had all but dried up: 277 Wednesday, down from 9,380 Monday. Some of the few asylum seekers on Wednesday who made it into Hungary said that their applications were summarily denied and they were sent back into Serbia. By Thursday, the camp along the Serbian-Hungarian border was quickly emptying as asylum seekers paid 20 euros apiece to get on buses that were ferrying them to the Croatian border.\n\nSo far the Serbs have been trying to be the perfect EU candidates, passing along the Muslims with a smile. Now, though, the Serbs are asking the EU powerbrokers: Please tell us what European Values means you want us to do. If you want us to help the Muslims along, we\u2019ll do that.

They were overruled by political aides.\u201d\n\nOverruled by political aides? This is simply damning.\n\nMarc Thiessen writes a weekly column for The Post on foreign and domestic policy and contributes to the PostPartisan blog. He is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. View Archive\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to get a lie into a presidential speech. Every draft address is circulated to the White House senior staff and key Cabinet officials in something called the \u201cstaffing process.\u201d Every line is reviewed by dozens of senior officials, who offer comments and factual corrections. During this process, it turns out, some of Obama\u2019s policy advisers objected to the \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d pledge, pointing out that it was untrue. But it stayed in the speech. That does not happen by accident. It requires a willful intent to deceive.\n\nIn the Bush White House, we speechwriters would often come up with what we thought were great turns of phrase to help the president explain his policies. But we also had a strict fact-checking process, where every iteration of every proposed presidential utterance was scrubbed to ensure it was both accurate and defensible. If the fact-checkers told us a line was inaccurate, we would either kill it or find another way to make the point accurately. I cannot imagine a scenario in which the fact-checkers or White House policy advisers would tell us that something in a draft speech was factually incorrect and that guidance would be ignored or overruled by the president\u2019s political advisers.\n\nThis whole episode is a window into a fundamentally dishonest presidency. And the story gets worse. After Obama began telling Americans they could keep their plans, White House aides discussed using media interviews \u201cto explain the nuances of the succinct line in his stump speeches.\u201d But they decided not to do so, because \u201cofficials worried . . . that delving into details such as the small number of people who might lose insurance could be confusing and would clutter the president\u2019s message.\u201d\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

He could have said \u201cmost Americans will be able to keep their plans.\u201d Or he could have said, as his communications director Dan Pfeiffer put it on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday, \u201cif you had a plan before the Affordable Care Act passed, [and] it hasn\u2019t been changed or canceled, you can keep it\u201d (which prompted McConnell spokesman Don Stewart to reply, \u201cSo . . . you can keep your plan \u2014 unless it\u2019s been cancelled. Gee, thanks.\u201d) That would certainly have been less powerful, but at least it would have been accurate.\n\nBut Obama didn\u2019t say those things. He said, \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health-care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.\u201d That statement was clear, unequivocal and wrong \u2014 and Obama and his advisers knew it.\n\nThe president\u2019s defenders are twisting around for ways to explain away his 16 words. The New York Times wrote in an editorial Sunday that \u201cMr. Obama clearly misspoke.\u201d Misspoke? On 24 separate occasions? Sorry, the president didn\u2019t \u201cmisspeak.\u201d This was an premeditated deception. This wasn\u2019t something Obama ad-libbed. It was a line in a presidential speech that was carefully reviewed by the entire White House senior staff. Obama\u2019s political advisers were told by his policy aides the statement was inaccurate \u2014 but they decided to let Americans believe the falsehood.\n\nObama\u2019s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, told the Journal that the speechwriters were working to find ways to explain a complex policy and that the goal was \u201csimplification and ease of explanation . . . while still being true.\u201d Except what Obama said wasn\u2019t true.\n\nEvery president faces the challenge of explaining complex policies in simple terms. But the quest for simplicity is no excuse for dishonesty.\n\nObama\u2019s own advisers told the Journal that they knew those 16 words were untrue, but Obama kept on saying them \u2014 over and over and over again.\n\n1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The worst media screw-ups of 2013 View Photos Washington Post media blogger Erik Wemple picks the biggest mistakes of the year.

But Kushner had read them in Hebrew as part of her Orthodox Jewish schooling, and the translations her Christian classmates knew well sounded nothing like the Hebrew to Kushner. With Robinson\u2019s encouragement, Kushner set out to collect a wide variety of English translations, then compare them with each other and with the Hebrew Bible.\n\nIn The Grammar of God, Kushner draws on this research to explore how the Bible in English translation differs from the Masoretic Text. Interspersed throughout are meditations on Kushner\u2019s family and schooling, some relevant to the Bible and some not so much\u2014for example, when Kushner tries to connect an anecdote about a vendor urging customers to buy two doughnuts to a phrase that appears twice in the account of the third day of Creation. Kushner touches on differences between traditional Jewish methods of interpretation and the way her Christian classmates and professor approached the Old Testament.\n\nThese divergent methods account for a great deal of misunderstanding of how Judaism relates to the Hebrew Bible. Kushner explains that Jews have traditionally read the Masoretic Text on a page crammed with commentaries that offer conflicting explanations of the holy words. These commentaries are guided by the rabbinic principles of exegesis, among them a rule that states that the order of events in the text need not be chronological; one commentator may hold that one event immediately follows another, while other commentators could say that an event from another part of the Bible came between them or that the order of events was reversed. The result is that Jewish readings treat the text as ambiguous and capable of conveying multiple meanings simultaneously. Kushner speculates that Christian reading styles might have grown to accommodate more ambiguity had the Geneva Bible with its marginal commentary not supplanted the King James or Authorized Edition of 1611.\n\nAlso important is the Oral Law, the body of Jewish legal literature that interprets the Masoretic Text and that frequently softens the harsher aspects of the legal code found in the Pentateuch. Kushner points out that Christian depictions of a wrathful Old Testament deity can be puzzling to Jews like her who see the Hebrew Bible through the lens of the Oral Law.

Thanks to prefixes and suffixes that pack information about person and tense into each word, Hebrew verses are shorter than English ones. A few standard suffixes create many instances of rhyme that cannot be replicated in the English. Repeated words and intensifiers add degrees of emphasis that are difficult to translate. And the meanings behind the names of Biblical figures are apparent at a glance to readers of the Hebrew; English readers, by contrast, see no relationship between \u201cAdam\u201d and \u201cearth\u201d or \u201cIsaac\u201d and \u201claughter\u201d without the help of a footnote. Reading these passages in The Grammar of God is probably as close as an English speaker can get to appreciating the sound of Hebrew without learning the language.\n\nIt is a bit disappointing that, despite her obvious sensitivity to language, Kushner stumbles when she criticizes certain choices made by the King James translators. For instance, she finds it outrageous that the noun p\u0304\u0101\u00b7re\u1e35 in Exodus 1:13 is translated as \u201crigour;\u201d Kushner claims that this translation makes slavery in Egypt sound sanitized and \u201cmanageable\u201d and prefers to render the word as \u201cbreaking labor.\u201d But the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s definitions for \u201crigour\u201d include \u201charshness,\u201d \u201cseverity,\u201d and \u201ccruelty,\u201d and its example sentences show that the word held those meanings in the early 17th century, when the Authorized Edition was being prepared.

If \u201crigour\u201d suggests standardized testing rather than slavery for contemporary readers, it is not Lancelot Andrewes\u2019 fault.\n\nKushner also objects to the translation of Psalm 42:3, which in the King James Bible begins, \u201cMy tears have been my meat day and night,\u201d and she asserts that \u201cmy meat\u201d would have been the correct translation of b\u0259-\u015b\u0101-r\u00ee, a Hebrew word meaning \u201cmy flesh\u201d that does not appear in this verse. But Kushner quotes with favor the medieval Jewish grammarian Ibn Janach, who defined le-\u1e25em, the noun used here, which literally means \u201cbread,\u201d as \u201csustenance.\u201d And the Oxford English Dictionary gives this definition for \u201cmeat\u201d: \u201cFood, as nourishment for people[\u2026] esp. solid food, as opposed to drink\u201d and shows that it was used in this way around the turn of the 16th century. Kushner favors the translation \u201cbread\u201d over \u201csustenance\u201d because it has the advantage of prompting the reader to recall other relevant verses that mention bread.

More specifically, it was the TV adaptation of Triangle at Rhodes, a Hercule Poirot mystery that combined the aspirational attractions of leisure on the Mediterranean, intrigue under parasols, and murder in evening dress. The center of the titular love triangle, when exhausted from lounging too long strenuous under hats too enormous, asks the waiter or admirer at hand to be a lamb and fetch her a pink gin. One night, her devoted husband waltzes across the hotel parquet with said cocktail. She downs it, she gasps, she clutches her bejeweled turban with a begloved hand\u2014and voila, murder most foul.\n\nWhile it would give me great pleasure to report that the pink gin was invented and championed by wealthy poisoners in foreign resorts, credit must go to the British Navy. Angostura bitters are said to have turned one\u2019s daily ration of Plymouth gin into a cure for seasickness, and, the story goes, officers brought the drink from the outposts of empire to the English bar. Now, you can (theoretically) order it chilled or at room temperature, on the rocks or in a coupe, with bitters stirred in or swirled and discarded as a rinse. But I knew that I wanted my gin exactly as I\u2019d seen it fall from Mrs. Chantry\u2019s nerveless fingers: served up, in a little cocktail glass, mixed with enough bitters to give it the color of deep pink-tinted rust.\n\nDrinks have aesthetic profiles that, in conjunction with the primary factors of smell and taste, help determine what we want in a particular mood, or season, or social context. Once, I joked that someone should invent a scotch that looks like a cosmo; a pink gin fills the need behind the joke, without doing criminal violence to honest whisky.\n\nDelicate, colorful, and floral; simple, bracing, and gin-forward, it is the perfect summer drink. Luckily for those in whom earthly joys might dull the pain of mortal blight and turn their eyes from heaven\u2019s promise, it is nearly impossible to order.\n\nMy friend warned me when I first embarked on my quest. She had asked for a pink gin at several New York bars.\n\n\u201cOrder something else,\u201d the bartender would bark, as he stirred organic mandrake root for a gin cocktail containing three different types of champagne. She ordered something else.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, B\u2014\u2014,\u201d I said, patting her hand, \u201cyou are naively fixated on the name \u2018pink gin\u2019? After all, it has only two ingredients, and can hardly be difficult to make. The bartenders are intimidated by a drink they do not recognize, but by listing the parts without attaching a moniker, we shall evade their little qualms. \u2018Be ye wise as serpents, et cetera.\u2019\u201d\n\nThus it was with the swagger of cunning and confidence that I strolled into the neighborhood\u2019s ritzy cocktail bar, where the town\u2019s wealthy and divorced smile at each other under soft lighting.\n\n\u201cPlymouth gin and angostura bitters, please.\u201d Watch and learn, my sweet B\u2014\u2014, how to obtain the drink that dare not speak its name.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have Plymouth.\u201d This I had not anticipated. But, like any covert operative worth her salt, I improvised. Hendrick\u2019s was the sweetest and most floral substitute I could think of on the spot.\n\n\u201cYou want it on the rocks?\u201d\n\nI was still flustered from the Hendrick\u2019s crisis, and had furthermore neglected to consider the particulars of how I wanted my undercover pink gin served. I decided to improvise further. This, in retrospect, was hubris, and punished accordingly.\n\n\u201cNo ice, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want it in a rocks glass, no ice?\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, could I have it up?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you do want ice?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014no\u2014I mean\u2014I just want it in the glass martinis come in.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you want a Hendrick\u2019s martini?\u201d\n\nMy voiced dropped a few decibels. The bar\u2019s patrons, though scant, were now watching with interest.\n\n\u201cNo, I want gin and Angostura bitters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I want it\u2014\u201d\n\nShe turned from the screen into which she punched her orders, and put down her shaker.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start again and tell me slowly, clearly, exactly what you want.\u201d Her voice was calm, and only a tad too friendly.\n\nI took a deep breath, and, without stopping for another, choked out the details of my order.\n\n\u201cSo you want a gin martini stirred, bitters instead of vermouth.\u201d\n\nI had meant to smuggle the cocktail into the lexicon of local mixology with an airy \u201cOh, this? This is a pink gin,\u201d not to pass it off as a debased martini. But I was a broken woman, and jumped at any cessation of hostilities, however shameful the terms.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. I paid for it and slunk away without making eye contact again.\n\nFor unrelated reasons, when next visiting my comrade-in-gin, I suggested that we make the drink ourselves. Gin aplenty we already had, and cocktail glasses\u2014lovely, fragile little curiosities\u2014we found at a thrift store, but no Angostura bitters. The local liquor store did not carry them, and the proprietor seemed faintly, though courteously, puzzled by our request. Perhaps under some ancient Blue laws bitters had been outlawed on the grounds that they rendered the call of strong liquor a bit too musical.\n\nHowever, this proved untrue the next afternoon, when we trekked across town to the wine store. As I had only threatened to faint from heat exhaustion four or five times on the way over, the rows of bitters lining the shelves beneath seemed to be virtue\u2019s just reward. There were Aztec Chocolate bitters, celery bitters, every type and disgusting subtype of bitters imaginable\u2014except Angostura. There was an alleged Angostura substitute, but in a drink with only two ingredients substitution felt like defeat. Besides, we did not trust the quaintly labeled bottle or its peddlers. The shop had lured us in with the promise of simple, sensible drinks for simple, sensible people; but in its bosom nursed the viper of faddishness.\n\nOur only option left was the pub, and the nearest available was not the type where two customers asking for a glass of bitters might pass as one of the day\u2019s many charming oddities. It was a sports bar, haunted by fraternity brothers, businessmen in salmon shorts, and other harbingers of misery. Forty-eight hours of failure, though, had lent our eyes a frantic gleam, and like two gunslingers bent on vengeance, we received a wide berth as we made our way through the saloon.\n\n\u201cCan you give us some Angostura bitters, ma\u2019am?\u201d I drawled, adjusting an invisible ten-gallon hat. Out of female solidarity I refrained from calling her \u201clittle lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust bitters?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to buy a bottle.\u201d\n\nShe cocked a crushing eyebrow, and I was a poor cowpoke a long way from home.\n\nIn the end it was the forces of law and order, not the bartender\u2019s skepticism, that defeated us. Selling alcoholic drinks for takeaway consumption was prohibited in bars, and in vain did we point out that we had come on foot and were as sober as the grave. We returned home to lick our wounds and sip mournful gin-and-limes. The wanton destruction of one\u2019s cherished hopes is no reason to invite scurvy.\n\nSuccess, like bitters, often materializes once you stop looking for it. In a grocery store, on a trip to pick up cheese and other household essentials, we found our Angostura bitters, nestled between gourmet root beers. The pink gins with which we toasted our formidable detective-work that night were frosty, rosy; perfect in their gold-rimmed coupes. After the first round it became apparent, to mutual disappointment, that neither of us was trying to poison the other; but in no other respect did the savor of victory bear any trace of disappointment\u2019s wormwood."], ["http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/crime/2014/09/11/inches-possible-black-hills/15434275/?from=global&sessionKey=&autologin=", "Rapid City sees earliest snowfall since 1888", "Steam and snow surround Mike Grimm waits for the engine of a vintage 1880 train to back into position in Hill City, S.D., Thursday morning, Sept. 11, 2014.

Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

The amendment, touted as \u201cgun control compromise,\u201d was crafted by Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) and it was defeated in the Senate in the first major vote of the session.\n\nThat the Manchin-Toomey background checks plan failed to pass the Senate is a good thing; the amendment was not a \u201ccompromise\u201d as it had been touted, and would not have solved any gun crime issues. The marketing propaganda mustered to attempt to sell it was itself built upon lies and misinformation, and President Obama\u2019s feigned moral outrage over its failure is both insulting and the true shame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Obama lost his mind when he told reporters at the White House: \u201cInstead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill\u201d. The President called the day \u201cshameful,\u201d and the White House sent out a mass email with the same wording. The president will forgive me if I\u2019m not moved. If you watched his address immediately following Sandy Hook and witnessed the fake tears flicked away from the outside of his eyes, you\u2019ll know what I mean. Shameful? This same president, who used many an opportunity to stand with children and parents of the victims (some would call that exploitation or grandstanding) in pleading the case for his version of a solution to children being senselessly murdered, also orders drone strikes that senselessly murder innocent. Lies? This is the same president who lied about Benghazi being a \u201cspontaneous demonstration\u201d for weeks. This amendment itself was based on lies. As I said, you\u2019ll forgive me if I\u2019m not moved by yet another false show of \u201cmoral outrage.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s talk about lies. This amendment was supposed to close the so-called \u201cgun show loophole.\u201d There is no such \u201cloophole.\u201d The amendment was also supposed to close the \u201conline loophole.\u201d This is an even bolder of a lie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president had falsely claimed that \u201cup to 40%\u201d of guns are bought without a background check via the so-called \u201cgun show loophole,\u201d for which the Washington Post Fact-Checker gave him two \u201cPinocchios\u201d (update: upped to three pinocchios) for being misleading. This false claim comes from a 1994 study of 251 people from before the Brady Bill required Federal Firearms Licensed (FFL) retail sellers to run background checks on all sales. The Washington Post reconnected with the original study authors who informed them the actual range is 14-22% with a +/- error margin of 6%, meaning the final range is 8-28%. That\u2019s nowhere near 40%. Also, factor in that it was before the Brady Bill was passed and it was from 1994. According to the ATF, federal law requires FFL holders to run a background check on all sales no matter where they are, retail storefront, and gun show, what have you. Failure to do so is already a crime.\n\nWhat about private sales? Private sales are from any private citizen who does not hold a FFL. These are, and have been since before the beginning of time, been 100% legal to another private, non-FFL holding person. Technically, the law states that if someone knowingly transfers a gun to a prohibited person (felon, mentally ill, etc.) they are breaking the law. But if you are not knowingly selling a firearm to such a person, you are not breaking the law. What about location? Does it matter if the private sale is in your driveway, parking lot, swap meet, gun show, or back alley? Nope. Private sale is private sale, regardless of whether there happen to be FFL\u2019s at the next table, or in the next county. Ostensibly, the concern is that continuing to \u201callow\u201d the \u201cinbred, non-showering, redneck hicks\u201d that attend gun shows the \u201cprivilege\u201d of selling their private property at gun shows is that crazed mass killers and terrorists are going to frequent gun shows to get fully automatic machine guns only to drive to the nearest mall or Kindergarten class with 2,000 rounds of ammunition and go out with a blaze of hellfire on our innocent hindquarters. This is pure fairy tale. The Department of Justice studies of where felons acquire their firearms show that less than 1% get them from gun shows. The majority \u2014 nearly 80% \u2014 of them gets them from (already) illegal transfer via family/friends, or from the black market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe myth about the online loophole is a clever-ish sort of new lie perpetrated by anti-gunners. To listen to them, you\u2019d think one could hop onto Amazon.com or some sort of \u201cGuns-R-Us.com,\u201d and order your made-for-mass-murder killing machine sent via UPS to your front door. Pure hogwash. There are plenty of online gun retailers, but none of them will ship you personally a gun; it must go to a FFL retailer who then must run a background check on you. Failure to do so is a crime. They are retailers, not black market underworld kingpins; they\u2019re in business to make money, not go to prison for yours or my sake. These retailers only ship guns to FFL holders. Not to mention that they themselves hold FFLs and must comply with the law governing retail sales regardless of location.\n\nWhat about private sales conducted online via classifieds? This is a little trickier. For one, many places like Craigslist, don\u2019t allow guns sales. But for classified ad sites that do allow them, this is no different than placing a classified ad in your local newspaper. It is, and always has been 100% legal. All the same rules discussed above still apply. If shipping out of state, it must go to an FFL; failure to do so is already a crime. If sold locally, there are no restrictions as has always been the case. If the president and gun control advocates wanted to refer to closing all \u201cprivate\u201d sales, and be honest about the fact that you\u2019re changing the law. Don\u2019t call it a \u201cloophole;\u201d which as I wrote previously, calling something a \u201cloophole\u201d that was never illegal to begin with, and doesn\u2019t involve \u201cgetting around\u201d something on a technicality, is itself a war waged with words and dishonest political gamesmanship. Gun control advocates might garner more support and sympathy if they didn\u2019t rely on lies to make their case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the president acts as if the Senate just guaranteed another mass shooting (though even Vice President Biden admits their anti-gun efforts won\u2019t prevent another mass shooting). The truth is that this amendment failed to address any of the issues inherently existent in our current system: failure to fund NICS (the background check system), failure of many states to report mental health and felony data to NICS, failure to address straw man purchases, failure to enforce and prosecute illegal transfer and background check fraud. And it fails to address the black market, illegal weapons trafficking (which is done by trans-national gangs according to the FBI), and theft \u2013 including targeted theft of police and military equipment.\n\nThe greatest lie of all is that this amendment would have done anything to decrease homicides or prevent another great tragedy. The decision to engage in lies and propaganda in lieu of actually addressing the underlying causes of violence and homicide in the U.S. is the real tragedy. That\u2019s what Obama and other politicians like him ought to be ashamed of.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Apr 23, 2013.

In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years.

So coupling that with the following facts, I feel qualified to offer my opinion and draw the conclusion that the current Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder and the administration he serves, not the citizens of this great country are the cowards he referenced in his now infamous \u201cNation of Cowards\u201d speech on the subject of American race relations. This judgment is based on the recent public service history of Mr. Holder and after a common sense review of that record.\n\nThe first incident which brought Mr. Holder to my attention was his involvement as the deputy attorney general advising the Clinton administration in the matter of the Marc Rich pardon. The news reports at the time piqued my interest and I was riveted to C-Span for the duration of the hearings. Although I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears, I was still perplexed as to Holder\u2019s admission that he was unaware of some key facts of the case as well as some procedural actions required in preparing the pardon for Mr. Rich. With I\u2019m sure what is more than a mediocre education, with a full working knowledge of the legal system, rules of evidence and court procedures, how could what seemed to be some basic or routine steps necessary in preparing a case, be missed by the lead attorney? At the very least and especially in the twelfth hour as this pardon was made, surely any prudent attorney would keep his immediate superior(s) apprised of the case? Janet Reno, attorney Holder\u2019s boss, seemed unaware of her subordinate\u2019s activities and his being ill-prepared to properly advise on the pardon. When pressed for reasons why pardon was granted, Mr. Holder stated the official position as \u201cneutral leaning favorable.\u201d Also he cites a \u201cdistraction by other matters and poor judgment\u201d as well. With the confusion and questions which still surround this matter, why did Ms. Reno fail to intervene?\n\nMore recent is the contempt of congress charge passed by the House of Representatives June 29, 2012. The charge stems from the investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee into the Fast and Furious \u201cgun-walking\u201d scheme in Arizona. It is alleged that Mr. Holder has failed to provide documents relevant to the investigation subpoenaed by congress. The death of border patrol agent Brian Terry possibly with a gun from this operation is also in question. Attorney general Holder and members of his staff insist no wrongdoing occurred and they are cooperating fully. In a comparative sense the tenor of Mr. Holder\u2019s testimony here and in the Marc Rich matter is quite similar. Both show the ability to answer questions with non-answers and become indignant when pressed to stop his filibuster.\n\nIt would seem that as the top law enforcement official in the country he would have been extremely disturbed by what most would call voter intimidation at the polls by members of the New Black Panther Party during the presidential election in Philadelphia 2008. Although a case was filed in 2009, the Department of Justice dropped the charges a few months later. Again it seems what appears a clear-cut case for Mr. Holder to exercise his authority and perform the requirements of his office was exchanged for political expediency. Certainly law enforcement officials have discretion when it comes to filing charges and proceeding with prosecutions, but this was in my view a case of selective non-prosecution because of the race of the accused. IS it not the sworn duty of the attorney general to apply the law equally? Blind justice and equal protection under the law is a basic tenet of our judicial system. Again, any review of the facts surrounding this matter will beg the question why did he not do his job?\n\nAnother example which I believe shows Mr. Holder\u2019s willingness to selectively apply \u201cequal justice under the law\u201d was during the Treyvon Martin/George Zimmerman trial. Why after exhaustive investigation into Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s past for incidents of racial discrimination and prejudice on Zimmerman\u2019s part, by local authorities and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and none was found, did the Attorney General of The United States do nothing to quell the racial flames which were brewing during proceedings? Instead he remained blissfully silent and tacitly compliant while the race traders misinformed the public and the embers of hate smoldered.\n\nThese examples and other decisions by this administration are the reasons to question the ability and sincerity of Eric Holder to follow his sworn oath to follow the Constitution and uphold the laws of the land. It seems his application of the law is determined by the direction of the current political wind and his preconceived notion of what justice should be; that is to say setting the record straight for past racial injustices irrespective of current law and without regard to sacrifices made by courageous leaders in the past to insure proper legal remedies are available for all. It is his continuing efforts to shade the truth, to delay the truth being known and using his office of privilege in unlawful ways which highlight his reluctance to show the courage which his office demands. By definition, Eric Holder and the entire Obama Administration are mired in cowardice.\n\nCommentary by Sherman Mays\n\nDignitas News Service Contributor\n\nSources:\n\nCNN (via EtrnalMediaYouTube)\n\n1470WFNTRadio\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nStumbleUpon\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], ["https://thebiggreenlie.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/if-you-dont-know-what-agenda-21-is-or-are-afraid-to-ask-read-this/", "If you don\u2019t know what Agenda 21 is, or are afraid to ask ..

City and County Councils have become war zones as citizens question the origins of development plans and planners deny any international connections to the UN\u2019s Agenda 21. What is the truth? Since I helped start this war, I believe it is up to me to help with the answers.\n\nLocal planning is a local idea.The standard points made by those who deny any Agenda 21 connection is that:\n\nAgenda 21 is a non-binding resolution not a treaty, carries no legal authority from which any nation is bound to act. It has no teeth.\n\nThe UN has no enforcement capability.\n\nThere are no \u201cBlue-Helmeted\u201d UN troops at City Hall.\n\nPlanners are simply honest professionals trying to do their job, and all these protests are wasting their valuable time.\n\nThe main concern of Agenda 21 is that man is fouling the environment and using up resources for future generations and we just need a sensible plan to preserve and protect the earth. What is so bad about that?\n\nThere is no hidden agenda.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read Agenda 21 and I can find no threatening language that says it is a global plot. What are you so afraid of?\u201d\n\nAnd of course, the most often heard response \u2013 \u201cAgenda 21, what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nAnd after they have proudly stated these well thought out points, they arrogantly throw down the gauntlet and challenge us to \u201canswer these facts.\u201d\n\nWill one of these \u201cinnocent\u201d promoters of the \u201cAgenda 21 is meaningless\u201d party line, please answer the following: Well, first I have a few questions of my own that I would love to have answered.\n\nIf it all means nothing, why does the UN spend millions of dollars to hold massive international meetings in which hundreds of leaders, potentates and high priests attend, along with thousands of non-governmental organizations of every description, plus the international news media, which reports every action in breathless anticipation of its impact on the world?\n\nIt if all means nothing, why do those same NGO representatives (which are all officially sanctioned by the UN in order to participate) spend months (sometimes years) debating, discussing, compiling, and drafting policy documents?\n\nIf it all means nothing, why do leaders representing nearly every nation in the world attend and, with great fanfare, sign these policy documents?\n\nTime after time we witness these massive international meetings, we read the documents that result from them, and when we question their meaning or possible impact on our nation, we are met with a dismissive shrug and a comment of \u201coh, probably not much\u2026\u201d\n\nReally? Then why? Why the waste of money, time, and human energy? Could it be that the only purpose is to simply give diplomats, bureaucrats, and NGOs a feeling of purpose in their meaningless lives, or perhaps a chance to branch out of their lonely apartments? Or could it really be that these meetings and the documents they produce are exactly as we say they are \u2013 a blueprint for policy, rules, regulations, perhaps even global governance that will affect the lives, fortunes, property and futures of every person on earth? Which is it? You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nWhy the fear of Agenda 21?\n\nThose who simply read or quickly scan Agenda 21 are puzzled by our opposition to what they see as a harmless, non-controversial document which they read as voluntary suggestions for preserving natural resources and protecting the environment. Why the fear? What exactly bothers us so much?\n\nThe problem is, we who oppose Agenda 21 have read and studied much more than this one document and we\u2019ve connected the dots. Many of us have attended those international meetings, rubbed elbows with the authors and leaders of the advocated policies, and overheard their insider (not for public distribution) comments about their real purpose.\n\nHere are a few examples of those comments made by major leaders of this movement as to the true purpose of the policies coming out of these UN meetings:\n\n\u201cNo matter if the science of global warming is all phony\u2026climate change provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.\u201d\n\nChristine Stewart (former Canadian Minister of the Environment)\n\n\u201cThe concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.\u201d Report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\n\u201cRegionalism must precede globalism. We foresee a seamless system of governance from local communities, individual states, regional unions and up through to the United Nations itself.\u201d Report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\nAll three of these quotes (and we have many) indicate using lies and rhetoric to achieve their goals, and that those goals include the elimination of national sovereignty and the creation of a \u201cseamless system\u201d for global governance. Again, do these quotes have meaning and purpose \u2013 do they reveal the true thoughts of the promoters of these policies, or were they just joking?\n\nFor the past three decades through the United Nations infrastructure, there have been a series of meetings, each producing another document or lynchpin to lay the groundwork for a centralized global economy, judicial system, military, and communications system, leading to what can only be described as a global government. From our study of these events, we have come to the conclusion that Agenda 21 represents the culmination of all of those efforts, indeed representing the step by step blueprint for the full imposition of those goals. Here\u2019s just a sample of these meetings and the documents they produced:\n\nIn 1980, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt chaired the Commission on International Development. The document, or report coming out of this effort, entitled \u201cNorth-South: A program for Survival,\u201d stated \u201cWorld development is not merely an economic process, [it] involves a profound transformation of the entire economic and social structure\u2026not only the idea of economic betterment, but also of greater human dignity, security, justice and equality\u2026The Commission realizes that mankind has to develop a concept of a \u2018single community\u2019 to develop global order.\u201d\n\nThat same year Sean MacBride, a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize, headed up a commission on international communications which issued a report entitled \u201cMany Voices, One World: Towards a New, More Just and More Efficient World Information and Communication Order.\u201d The Commission, which included the head of the Soviet news Agency, TASS, believed that a \u201cNew World Information Order\u201d was prerequisite to a new world economic order. The report was a blueprint for controlling the media, even to the point of suggesting that international journalists be licensed.\n\nIn 1982, Olof Palme, the man who single-handedly returned Socialism to Sweden, served as chairman of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues. His report, entitled \u201cCommon Security: A Blueprint for Survival,\u201d said: \u201cAll States have the duty to promote the achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control\u2026\u201d The report went on to call for money that is saved from disarmament to be used to pay for social programs. The Commission also proposed a strategic shift from \u201ccollective security\u201d such as the alliances like NATO, to one of \u201ccommon security\u201d through the United Nations.\n\nFinally, in 1987, came the granddaddy commission of them all, The Brundtland Commission on Environment and Development. Headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Vice President of the World Socialist Party, the commission introduced the concept of \u201cSustainable Development.\u201d For the first time the environment was tied to the tried and true Socialist goals of international redistribution of wealth. Said the report, \u201cPoverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.\u201d\n\nThese four commissions laid the groundwork for an agenda of global control; A controlled media would dictate the flow of information and ideas and prevent dissent; control of international development manages and redistributes wealth; full disarmament would put the power structure into the hands of those with armaments; and tying environmentalism to poverty and economic development would bring the entire agenda to the level of an international emergency.\n\nOne world, one media, one authority for development, one source of wealth, one international army. The construction of a \u201cjust society\u201d with political and social equality rather than a free society with the individual as the sole possessor of rights. The next step was to pull it altogether into a simple blueprint for implementation.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the UN sponsored a series of summits and conferences dealing with such issues as human rights, the rights of the child, forced abortion and sterilization as solutions for population control, and plans for global taxation through the UN.\n\nThroughout each of these summits, hundreds of Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worked behind the scenes to write policy documents pertaining to each of these issues, detailing goals and a process to achieve them. These NGO\u2019s are specifically sanctioned by the United Nations in order to participate in the process. The UN views them as \u201ccivil society, the non governmental representatives of the people. In short, in the eyes of the UN, the NGOs are the \u201cpeople.\u201d\n\nWho are they? They include activist groups with private political agendas including the Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, The Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation, Zero Population Growth, Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, the National Education Association, an d hundreds more. These groups all have specific political agendas which they desire to become law of the land. Through work in these international summits and conferences, their political wish lists become official government policy.\n\nIn fact, through the UN infrastructure the NGOs sit in equality to government officials from member nations including the United States. One of the most powerful UN operations is the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). Created in 1973 by the UN General Assembly, the UNEP is the catalyst through which the global environmental agenda is implemented. Virtually all international environmental programs and policy changes that have occurred globally in the past three decades are a result of UNEP efforts. Sitting in on UNEP meetings, helping to write and implement policy, along with these powerful NGOs are government representatives, including U.S, federal agencies such as the Department of State, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThis, then, is a glimpse of the power structure behind the force that gathered in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 for the UN-sponsored Earth Summit. Here, five major documents, written primarily by NGOs with the guidance and assistance of government agencies, were introduced to the world. In fact, these final documents had been first drafted and honed though the long, arduous series of international conferences previously mentioned. Now, at Rio, they were ready for adoption as a blueprint for what could only be described as the transformation of human society.\n\nThe five documents were: the \u201cConvention on Climate Change,\u201d the precursor to the coming Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, later adopted in 1997; the \u201cBiodiversity Treaty,\u201d which would declare that massive amounts of land should be off limits to human development; the third document was called the \u201cRio Declaration,\u201d which called for the eradication of poverty throughout the world through the redistribution of wealth; the fourth document was the \u201cConvention on Forest Principles,\u201d calling for international management of the world\u2019s forests, essentially shutting down or severely regulating the timber industry; and the fifth document was Agenda 21, which contained the full agenda for implementing worldwide Sustainable Development. The 300 page document contains 40 chapters that address virtually every facet of human life and contains great detail as to how the concept of Sustainable Development should be implemented through every level of government.\n\nWhat did the United Nations believe that process entailed? In 1993, to help explain the far-reaching aspects of the plan, the UN published \u201cAgenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet.\u201d Here\u2019s how the UN described Agenda 21 in that document: \u201cAgenda 21 proposes an array of actions which are intended to be implemented by every person on earth\u2026it calls for specific changes in the activities of all people\u2026Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all humans, unlike anything the world has ever experienced.\u201d I have never read a stronger, more powerful description of the use of government power.\n\nHowever, critics of our efforts against Agenda 21 rush to point out that Agenda 21 is a \u201csoft law\u201d policy \u2013 not a treaty that must be ratified by the U.S. Senate to become law. So it is just a suggestion, nothing to be afraid of. To make such an argument means that these critics have failed to follow the bouncing ball of implementation.\n\nFollowing the bouncing ball to implementation\n\nIt started when, at the Earth Summit, President George H.W. Bush, along with 179 other heads of state signed agreement to Agenda 21. One year later, newly elected President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order # 12852 to create the President\u2019s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD). The Council consisted of 12 cabinet secretaries, top executives from business, and executives from six major environmental organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, The Sierra Club, the World Resources Institute, and the National Wildlife Federation. These were all players in the creation of Agenda 21 at the international level \u2013 now openly serving on the PCSD with the specific mission to implement Agenda 21 into American policy.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the pages of the PCSD report entitled \u201cSustainable America: A new Consensus for the Future, it directly quotes the Brundtland Commission\u2019s report \u201cOur Common Future\u201d for a definition of Sustainable Development. That is about as direct a tie to the UN as one can get. The PCSD brought the concept of Sustainable Development into the policy process of every agencies of the US federal government\n\nA major tool for implementation was the enormous grant-making power of the federal government. Grant programs were created through literally every agency to entice states and local communities to accept Sustainable Development policy in local programs. In fact, the green groups serving on the PCSD, which also wrote Agenda 21 in the first place, knew full well what programs needed to be implemented to enforce Sustainable Development policy, and they helped create the grant programs, complete with specific actions that must be taken by communities to assure the money is properly spent to implement Sustainable Development policy. Those are the \u201cstrings\u201d to which we opponents refer. Such tactics make the grants effective weapons to insure the policy is moving forward.\n\nFrom that point, these same NGOs sent their members into the state legislatures to lobby for and encourage policy and additional state grant programs. They have lobbied for states to produce legislation requiring local communities to implement comprehensive development plans. Once that legislation was in place, the same NGOs (authors of Agenda 21) quickly moved into the local communities to \u201chelp\u201d local governments comply with the state mandates. And they pledged to help by showing communities how to acquire the grant money to pay for it \u2013 with the above mentioned strings attached.\n\nWe\u2019re told over and over again that such policies are local, state and national, with no conspiracy of ties to the UN. Really? Then how are we to explain this message, taken from the Federal Register, August 24, 1998, (Volume 63, Number 163) from a discussion on the EPA Sustainable Development Challenge Grant Program? It says, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Challenge Grant Program is also a step in Implementing \u2018Agenda 21, the Global Plan of Action on Sustainable Development,\u2019 signed by the United Stats at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. All of these programs require broad community participation to identify and address environmental issues.\u201d\n\nOr consider this quote from a report by Phil Janik, Chief Operating Officer of the USDA \u2013 Forest Service, entitled \u201cThe USDA-Forest Service Commitment and Approach to Forest Sustainability\u201d \u201cIn Our Common Future published in 1987, the Brundtland Commission explains that \u2018the environment is where we all live; and development is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode.\u201d In short, Janik was explaining to his audience (the Society of American Foresters) just where the Forest Service was getting its definition of Sustainable Development \u2013 the report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\nMeanwhile, the NGOs began to \u201cpartner\u201d with other governmental organizations like the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Governors Association, the National League of Cities, the National Association of County Administrators and more organizations to which elected representatives belong to, assuring a near that a near universal message of Sustainable Development comes from every level of government.\n\nAnother NGO group which helped write Agenda 21 for the UN Earth Summit was a group originally called the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). It now calls itself ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability. After the Earth Summit in 1992, ICLEI set its mission to move into the policy process of local governments around the world to impose Sustainable Development policy. It now operates in more than 1200 cities globally, including 600 American cities, all of which pay dues for the privilege of working with ICLEI. Like a cancer, ICLEI begins to infest the local government policy, training city employees to think only in terms of Sustainable Development, and replacing local guidelines with international codes, rules and regulations.\n\nSo it\u2019s true, there are no UN blue helmeted troops occupying city halls in America, and yes, the UN itself does not have enforcement capability for this \u201c:non-binding\u201d document called Agenda 21. However, it does have its own storm troopers in the person of the Non-governmental Organizations which the UN officially sanctions to carry on its work. And that is how Agenda 21, a UN policy, has become a direct threat to local American communities.\n\nWhy we oppose Agenda 21\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that we fight Agenda 21 because we oppose its policies and its process, not just its origins. Why do we see it as a threat? Isn\u2019t it just a plan to protect the environment and stop uncontrolled development and sprawl?\n\nAs Henry Lamb of Freedom 21 puts it, \u201cComprehensive land use planning that delivers sustainable development to local communities transforms both the process through which decisions that govern citizens are made, and the market place where citizens must earn their livelihood. The fundamental principle that government is empowered by the consent of the governed is completely by-passed in the process\u2026the natural next step is for government to dictate the behavior of the people who own the land that the government controls.\u201d\n\nTo enforce the policy, local government is being transformed by \u201cstakeholder councils\u201d created and enforced by the same NGO Agenda 21 authors. They are busy creating a matrix of non-elected boards, councils and regional governments that usurp the ability of citizens to have an impact on policy. It\u2019s the demise of representative government. And the councils appear and grow almost overnight.\n\nSustainablists involve themselves in every aspect of society. Here are just a few of the programs and issues that can be found in the Agenda 21 blueprint and can be easily found in nearly every community\u2019s \u201clocal\u201d development plans: Wetlands, conservation easements, water sheds, view sheds, rails \u2013 to- trails, biosphere reserves, greenways, carbon footprints, partnerships, preservation, stakeholders, land use, environmental protection, development, diversity, visioning, open space, heritage areas and comprehensive planning. Every one of these programs leads to more government control, land grabs and restrictions on energy, water, and our own property. When we hear these terms we know that such policy originated on the pages of Agenda 21, regardless of the direct or indirect path it took to get to our community.\n\nYou\u2019ll find Watershed Councils that regulate human action near every trickling stream, river, or lake. Meters are put on wells. Special \u201caction\u201d councils control home size, tree pruning, or removal, even the color you can paint your home or the height of your grass. Historic preservation councils control development in downtown areas, disallowing expansion and new building.\n\nRegional governments are driven by NGOs and stakeholder councils with a few co-opted bureaucrats thrown in to look good. These are run by non-elected councils that don\u2019t answer to the people. In short, elected officials become little more than a rubber stamp to provide official \u201capproval\u201d to the regional bureaucracy.\n\nBut the agenda outlined in Agenda 21 and by its proponents is a much bigger threat that just land use planning. They openly advocate massive reduction of human populations. Some actually call for as much as an 85% reduction in human populations in order to \u201csave the planet.\u201d David Brower of the Sierra Club said, \u201cChildbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license.\u201d The UN\u2019s Biodiversity Assessment says, \u201cA reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present North American material standard of living would be 1 billion.\u201d\n\nThey also openly advocate the destruction of modern society as Maurice Strong, the head of the Earth Summit said, \u201cIsn\u2019t the only hope for the planet that the industrial nations collapse? Isn\u2019t it our responsibility to bring that about?\n\nThis issue then is not about simple environmental protection and modern planning. It is about a complete restructuring of our society, our values and our way of life. They use as their model an urgency based on global warming and climate change, claiming there is no need for discussion on these dire issues. Yet science is showing more and more proof that there is no man-made global warming. Are we to completely destroy our society based on such a shaky foundation?\n\nAnd that is just what the proponents are rushing to do.\n\nBarack Obama has issued a flurry of Executive Orders to bypass the Congressional process and dictate sustainable policy. In 2011 Obama issued EO # 13575 creating the White House Rural Council. It brings together 25 Cabinet Secretaries to enforce multi-jurisdictional enforcement of farming virtually controlling every decision for food production. It is a major assault on American farm production intended to enforce Sustainable farming practices. In truth it will only lead to food shortages and higher prices as farmers have no ability to make a decision without the approval of 25 government agencies, working at cross purposes and causing chaos in farm production.\n\nOn May1, 2012, Obama issued EO # 13609, dictating that the government must enforce coordination of international regulatory policy. Those international regulatory policies are UN-driven and the basic translation means enforcement of Sustainable Development policy.\n\nBut, again, skeptics of our fears of Agenda 21 continue to argue that it is all voluntary and if the US or local governments want to enforce it they are free to do so \u2013 nothing to fear but ourselves. Well, even if that were true, that\u2019s all about to change. On June 15 \u2013 23, international forces are again converging on Rio for Rio+20. The stated intention is to complete the work they began in 1992.\n\nSpecifically called for is a UN treaty on Sustainable Development. If passed by the Senate and signed by the Obama Administration, that will eliminate any ambiguity about where the policy is coming from. Moreover, documents produced so far for the summit call for a global council, new UN agencies, budgets and powers, and \u201cgenuine global actions\u201d in every nation \u2013 to ensure \u201csocial justice,\u201d poverty eradication, climate protection, biodiversity, \u201cgreen growth,\u201d and an end to \u201cunsustainable patterns of consumption.\u201d Again, thousands of NGOs, diplomats and world leaders will spend a lot of money and time in the Rio+20 effort. Is it all just for fun, or does it have a purpose with strong consequences for our way of life?\n\nThe fact is, we fight Agenda 21 because it is all-encompassing, designed to address literally every aspect of our lives. This is so because those promoting Agenda 21 believe we must modify our behavior, our way of doing everyday things, and even our belief system, in order to drastically transform human society into being \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\nWe who oppose it don\u2019t believe that the world is in such dire emergency environmentally that we must destroy the very human civilization that brought us from a life of nothing but survival against the elements into a world that gave us homes, health care, food, and even luxury. Sustainable Development advocates literally hope to roll back our civilization to the days of mere survival and we say NO. Why should we? We have found great deception in the promotion of the global warming argument. We believe in free markets and free societies where people make their own decisions, live and develop their own property. And we fully believe that the true path to a strong protection of the environment is through private property ownership and limited government. Those who promote Agenda 21 do not believe in those ideals. And so we will not agree on the path to the future. And our fight is just that \u2013 a clash of philosophy. There is very little room for middle ground.\n\nThe United States has never been part of a global village in which rules for life have been handed down by some self-appointed village elders. We are a nation of laws that were designed to protect our right to our property and our individual life choices while keeping government reined in. We oppose Agenda 21 precisely because it represents the exact opposite view of government.\n\nPART 2\n\nAGENDA 21 CONSPIRACY THEORY OR THREAT\n\nPART 2 of 2\n\nby Tom DeWeese\n\nMay 21, 2012\n\nNewsWithViews.com\n\nThe five documents were: the \u201cConvention on Climate Change,\u201d the precursor to the coming Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, later adopted in 1997; the \u201cBiodiversity Treaty,\u201d which would declare that massive amounts of land should be off limits to human development; the third document was called the \u201cRio Declaration,\u201d which called for the eradication of poverty throughout the world through the redistribution of wealth; the fourth document was the \u201cConvention on Forest Principles,\u201d calling for international management of the world\u2019s forests, essentially shutting down or severely regulating the timber industry; and the fifth document was Agenda 21, which contained the full agenda for implementing worldwide Sustainable Development. The 300 page document contains 40 chapters that address virtually every facet of human life and contains great detail as to how the concept of Sustainable Development should be implemented through every level of government.\n\nWhat did the United Nations believe that process entailed? In 1993, to help explain the far-reaching aspects of the plan, the UN published \u201cAgenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet.\u201d Here\u2019s how the UN described Agenda 21 in that document: \u201cAgenda 21 proposes an array of actions which are intended to be implemented by every person on earth\u2026it calls for specific changes in the activities of all people\u2026Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all humans, unlike anything the world has ever experienced.\u201d I have never read a stronger, more powerful description of the use of government power.\n\nHowever, critics of our efforts against Agenda 21 rush to point out that Agenda 21 is a \u201csoft law\u201d policy \u2013 not a treaty that must be ratified by the U.S. Senate to become law. So it is just a suggestion, nothing to be afraid of. To make such an argument means that these critics have failed to follow the bouncing ball of implementation.\n\nFollowing the bouncing ball to implementation\n\nREAD MORE HERE:"], ["http://thehilltalk.com/2015/09/07/former-clinton-aide-pleads-the-fifth-not-cooperating-with-investigators/", "Former Clinton aide pleads the Fifth, not cooperating with investigators", "Former Clinton IT specialist Bryan Pagliano has informed the House Benghazi Select Committee that he will be invoking his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions regarding the secret private email server that Hillary Clinton used while Secretary of State.\n\nHowever, in an August 31 letter to Congress, Pagliano\u2019s attorney said the former 2008 campaign staffer who installed and managed Clinton\u2019s personal server and left his IT job at the State Department in February 2013, the same month Clinton stepped down as secretary, would \u201crespectfully assert his Fifth Amendment right\u201d before the Benghazi Select Committee. \u201cThe matters for which Mr. Pagliano\u2019s testimony and documents are being sought by the Select Committee are also the subject of investigative activity by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice,\u201d the letter said.\n\nDespite using the investigations by the FBI and DOJ as the reason to plead the Fifth, it has been reported that Pagliano is refusing to cooperate with investigators from either probe. Apparently this follows a pattern of refusals to cooperate that go back as far as the original inspector general investigation back in the early summer.\n\nPagliano had worked with Clinton going back to at least 2006, serving on her original presidential campaign then later at the State Department with continuing duties overseeing the email server. Last week Clinton claimed to have used the secret private email server going back at least to her time as senator from New York:\n\n\u201cI did all my business on my personal email [in the Senate],\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI was not thinking a lot when I got in [to the State Department]. There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world. I didn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be.\u201d \u201cThis was fully above board, people knew I was using a personal email, I did it for convenience. I sent emails that I thought were work related to people\u2019s dot gov accounts,\u201d she added.\n\nThis last statement is a direct contradiction to evidence previously revealed that showed that Clinton and her aides had sent information that would later be determined to be classified to at least six other people\u2019s private email addresses, including non-government employee Sidney Blumenthal, the longtime ClintonWorld loyalist who was blocked from taking a position at State by the Obama Administration due to rumors he had spread about President Obama during the 2008 campaign.\n\nAs the Baltimore Sun said today \u201cThere is a smoking gun. In fact, there\u2019s a whole smoking arsenal\u201d.\n\n[Fox News][Yahoo News][NBC News][Baltimore Sun][Photo Credit: The Daily Signal]"], ["http://2ndamendmentfight.com/7-anti-gun-myths-that-need-to-be-debunked-immediately/", "7 Anti-gun Myths That Need To Be Debunked Immediately", "America\u2019s gun control debate is rife with myths and falsehoods. In the Information Age we often face a lot of misinformation, and gun control is unfortunately often the poster child of misinformation.Here are some of the ways you are being misled.\n\n1. \u201cAssault Weapons\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term \u201cassault weapon\u201d is a made-up political term. AR-15\u2019s are not military rifles; so unscrupulous politicians refer to them as \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons.\u201d \u2018Style\u2019 \u2013 as in cosmetic appearance \u2013 is the only true word in that description. The Military uses the M4A1 carbine rifle, which looks outwardly very much like an AR-15, but they do not have the same functionality; AR-15s are not machine guns, though the terminology used is meant to imply they are. Senator Diane Feinstein (R-Calif.) says AR-15\u2019s are designed for killing as many people in close quarters combat as possible, when in fact the AR-15 is an intermediate to distance rifle with a range of 400-600m. Feinstein and others claim AR-15\u2019s are not used for hunting; but in fact there are dozens of varieties of AR-15 used for hunting everything from varmint/small game to deer, elk, and dangerous game. The AR-15 is not the weapon of choice for most mass shooters according to James Alan Fox, a highly respected criminologist from Northeastern University in Boston; handguns are. In fact, rifle homicides comprise a very small amount of homicides, accounting for less than 3% of homicides (323 out of 12,664 in 2011) mass shootings or otherwise.\n\n2. \u201cHigh Capacity Magazines\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome politicians would have us believe that so-called \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are responsible for a wave of death sweeping the nation. Academic, scholarly research shows the vast majority of homicides average four shots with less than 10 shots fired. While the Aurora shooter infamously used a 100-round magazine drum, these are novelty items that are prone to jam. In fact, it did jam probably saving lives. But mass shooters don\u2019t need 100-round magazines to commit atrocity \u2013 the shooters at Virginia Tech and Columbine used 10-round magazines, they just brought a lot of them (17 and 13 respectively). James Alan Fox states mass shooters often meticulously plan their attacks in advance; a high capacity magazine ban will not deter them as Virginia Tech and Columbine illustrate.\n\n3. Gun Show \u201cLoophole\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral people, including President Obama have stated that 40% of guns were bought via \u201cgun show loopholes.\u201d This is not true. For one, the term \u201cgun show loophole\u201d implies that people are deviously getting around something when in actuality; it is just selling personal private property and is not illegal or nefarious. Additionally, private sales may not actually occur at a gun show at all. More important than loose terminology is that this claim is based on a study from 1994 of 251 people. The Washington Post evaluated this claim with the study\u2019s original authors and says the president distorted the truth. The actual range is 14%-22% with a plus or minus error margin of 6%. This means the final accurate range of this study is as low as 8%, but no more than 28%; neither figure is 40%. Further, it\u2019s implied that closing private sales would solve the issue of criminals obtaining guns; it doesn\u2019t. It fails to address illegal trafficking and straw man purchases. A Department of Justice study indicates that 78.8% of criminals get guns from friends or family (39.6%) or from the street/illegally (39.2%). To this point, the FBI states there are 1.2 million gang members in U.S. and that gangs illegally traffic guns as addition to narcotics.\n\n4. Mass Shootings Are Not Increasing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, Mother Jones and others have claimed that mass shootings are increasing. Once again not true. James Alan Fox\u2019s analysis of the Mother Jones\u2018 study indicates they left out mass murders which made it seem there was an increase after the Federal assault weapon ban expired (they\u2019ve updated their story since). Some mass murders receive more media attention than others, however the number has been consistently about 20 annually since 1976. The number dead from these mass shootings fluctuates from about 25 to 150, depending on the year (Fox\u2019s chart is shown above). In 2012, it was less than 100. Though tragic, this represents a fraction of 1% of homicides. In recent years, homicides by raw number peaked in 1991 at 24,700; it\u2019s dropped in half since, and the homicide rate per 100,000 people today is less than it was even in 1900 (see below).\n\n5. Anti-Gun Organizations Lump in Suicide & Injuries With Crime Data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a mass murder shooting anti-gun organizations like the Brady campaign inevitably call for gun restrictions; these organizations also cite gun violence data other than crime data to include suicides and injuries. This is misleading. Although accidents and suicide are public health concerns, it is disingenuous to include them with homicide in response to a horrific crime. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), suicide rates have crept up slightly 2000-2009, but are still lower than the rate per 100,000 from 1950-1990. It\u2019s not accurate to say guns contribute to suicide causal factors since the rate is lower now. And ultimately, legislation aimed to prevent crime by banning weapons and limiting magazine capacity has no reasonable connection to either suicide or accidents. We ought to compare apples to apples: suicide with suicide prevention, accidents with safety programs, and homicide with policy that would realistically reduce homicide.\n\n6. Too Many Are Being Killed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement is political gaming and wordplay. How many dead would be okay? Who wouldn\u2019t want less murder? Ideally, zero would be the goal, but that begs the question of how to prevent any tendency of violence in humans. This phrase is not only meaningless in terms of contributing to policy that achieves a positive end result, but also dangerous in that the appeal to emotion runs the risk of circumventing genuine solution in favor of sound byte. It makes sense to try to achieve goals with policies other than those proven to be ineffective, as the previous Federal assault weapons ban was. Lastly, homicides are at an all time low.\n\n7. False Zero-Sum Dichotomy \u2013 \u201cEither/Or\u201d:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamous anti-gun rights advocate New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, \u201cI want the Congress to have to stand up and say \u2018I\u2019m with the NRA and support killing our children\u2019, or \u2018No'\u201d (Time magazine, January 28, 2013, p.30). On CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan, Congressman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said, \u201cthe NRA is enablers of mass murder.\u201d This overly simplistic incendiary rhetoric does nothing to further our national discussion, and falsely frames the debate as a zero-sum, winner-take-all, \u2018either/or\u2019 proposition \u2013 either you hug a gun or hug a kid, but you couldn\u2019t possibly be for both gun rights and your child\u2019s safety. That is preposterous. The NRA is not \u201cthe gun industry,\u201d and preservation of the Second Amendment is not of interest only to gun manufacturers. Nearly half of NRA funding comes from individual donors. The NRA is comprised of average people who want safe neighborhoods, schools, and streets. Rather than offer ridiculous false dichotomy and grandstanding, we should be looking for genuine solutions.\n\nBONUS: We Need More Laws:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the granddaddy lie. We already have a lot of laws. It\u2019s illegal to kill your mom, steal a gun, take that gun onto school property, forcibly break and enter, and murder kids. We already have laws preventing mentally ill & felons from obtaining guns, and we have a background check system (NICS). The Sandy Hook shooter was denied to legally purchase a gun because of the NICS system. We tried a federal assault weapons ban (AWB) before. What we do need is better enforcement of existing laws. Congress has not fully funded NICS. Many states do not fully report felony and mental health data to NICS. The Justice Department only prosecutes a fraction of those who criminally falsify background check forms. We desperately need to engage in genuine discussion about real solutions to the violence problem. These solutions are not likely to yield instantaneous results, or win the next election cycle; yet it is what we would do if we were serious about addressing the issue. The underlying causes include: gang activity, which accounts for 48-90% of violent crime depending on jurisdiction; drug abuse, the single biggest predictor of violence with-or-without mental illness; concentrated urban population and poverty; and mental illness, including de-institutionalization, treatment and intervention, and other facets of mental health.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com.

City and County Councils have become war zones as citizens question the origins of development plans and planners deny any international connections to the UN\u2019s Agenda 21. What is the truth? Since I helped start this war, I believe it is up to me to help with the answers.\n\nLocal planning is a local idea.The standard points made by those who deny any Agenda 21 connection is that:\n\nAgenda 21 is a non-binding resolution not a treaty, carries no legal authority from which any nation is bound to act. It has no teeth.\n\nThe UN has no enforcement capability.\n\nThere are no \u201cBlue-Helmeted\u201d UN troops at City Hall.\n\nPlanners are simply honest professionals trying to do their job, and all these protests are wasting their valuable time.\n\nThe main concern of Agenda 21 is that man is fouling the environment and using up resources for future generations and we just need a sensible plan to preserve and protect the earth. What is so bad about that?\n\nThere is no hidden agenda.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read Agenda 21 and I can find no threatening language that says it is a global plot. What are you so afraid of?\u201d\n\nAnd of course, the most often heard response \u2013 \u201cAgenda 21, what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nAnd after they have proudly stated these well thought out points, they arrogantly throw down the gauntlet and challenge us to \u201canswer these facts.\u201d\n\nWill one of these \u201cinnocent\u201d promoters of the \u201cAgenda 21 is meaningless\u201d party line, please answer the following: Well, first I have a few questions of my own that I would love to have answered.\n\nIf it all means nothing, why does the UN spend millions of dollars to hold massive international meetings in which hundreds of leaders, potentates and high priests attend, along with thousands of non-governmental organizations of every description, plus the international news media, which reports every action in breathless anticipation of its impact on the world?\n\nIt if all means nothing, why do those same NGO representatives (which are all officially sanctioned by the UN in order to participate) spend months (sometimes years) debating, discussing, compiling, and drafting policy documents?\n\nIf it all means nothing, why do leaders representing nearly every nation in the world attend and, with great fanfare, sign these policy documents?\n\nTime after time we witness these massive international meetings, we read the documents that result from them, and when we question their meaning or possible impact on our nation, we are met with a dismissive shrug and a comment of \u201coh, probably not much\u2026\u201d\n\nReally? Then why? Why the waste of money, time, and human energy? Could it be that the only purpose is to simply give diplomats, bureaucrats, and NGOs a feeling of purpose in their meaningless lives, or perhaps a chance to branch out of their lonely apartments? Or could it really be that these meetings and the documents they produce are exactly as we say they are \u2013 a blueprint for policy, rules, regulations, perhaps even global governance that will affect the lives, fortunes, property and futures of every person on earth? Which is it? You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nWhy the fear of Agenda 21?\n\nThose who simply read or quickly scan Agenda 21 are puzzled by our opposition to what they see as a harmless, non-controversial document which they read as voluntary suggestions for preserving natural resources and protecting the environment. Why the fear? What exactly bothers us so much?\n\nThe problem is, we who oppose Agenda 21 have read and studied much more than this one document and we\u2019ve connected the dots. Many of us have attended those international meetings, rubbed elbows with the authors and leaders of the advocated policies, and overheard their insider (not for public distribution) comments about their real purpose.\n\nHere are a few examples of those comments made by major leaders of this movement as to the true purpose of the policies coming out of these UN meetings:\n\n\u201cNo matter if the science of global warming is all phony\u2026climate change provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.\u201d\n\nChristine Stewart (former Canadian Minister of the Environment)\n\n\u201cThe concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.\u201d Report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\n\u201cRegionalism must precede globalism. We foresee a seamless system of governance from local communities, individual states, regional unions and up through to the United Nations itself.\u201d Report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\nAll three of these quotes (and we have many) indicate using lies and rhetoric to achieve their goals, and that those goals include the elimination of national sovereignty and the creation of a \u201cseamless system\u201d for global governance. Again, do these quotes have meaning and purpose \u2013 do they reveal the true thoughts of the promoters of these policies, or were they just joking?\n\nFor the past three decades through the United Nations infrastructure, there have been a series of meetings, each producing another document or lynchpin to lay the groundwork for a centralized global economy, judicial system, military, and communications system, leading to what can only be described as a global government. From our study of these events, we have come to the conclusion that Agenda 21 represents the culmination of all of those efforts, indeed representing the step by step blueprint for the full imposition of those goals. Here\u2019s just a sample of these meetings and the documents they produced:\n\nIn 1980, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt chaired the Commission on International Development. The document, or report coming out of this effort, entitled \u201cNorth-South: A program for Survival,\u201d stated \u201cWorld development is not merely an economic process, [it] involves a profound transformation of the entire economic and social structure\u2026not only the idea of economic betterment, but also of greater human dignity, security, justice and equality\u2026The Commission realizes that mankind has to develop a concept of a \u2018single community\u2019 to develop global order.\u201d\n\nThat same year Sean MacBride, a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize, headed up a commission on international communications which issued a report entitled \u201cMany Voices, One World: Towards a New, More Just and More Efficient World Information and Communication Order.\u201d The Commission, which included the head of the Soviet news Agency, TASS, believed that a \u201cNew World Information Order\u201d was prerequisite to a new world economic order. The report was a blueprint for controlling the media, even to the point of suggesting that international journalists be licensed.\n\nIn 1982, Olof Palme, the man who single-handedly returned Socialism to Sweden, served as chairman of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues. His report, entitled \u201cCommon Security: A Blueprint for Survival,\u201d said: \u201cAll States have the duty to promote the achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control\u2026\u201d The report went on to call for money that is saved from disarmament to be used to pay for social programs. The Commission also proposed a strategic shift from \u201ccollective security\u201d such as the alliances like NATO, to one of \u201ccommon security\u201d through the United Nations.\n\nFinally, in 1987, came the granddaddy commission of them all, The Brundtland Commission on Environment and Development. Headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Vice President of the World Socialist Party, the commission introduced the concept of \u201cSustainable Development.\u201d For the first time the environment was tied to the tried and true Socialist goals of international redistribution of wealth. Said the report, \u201cPoverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.\u201d\n\nThese four commissions laid the groundwork for an agenda of global control; A controlled media would dictate the flow of information and ideas and prevent dissent; control of international development manages and redistributes wealth; full disarmament would put the power structure into the hands of those with armaments; and tying environmentalism to poverty and economic development would bring the entire agenda to the level of an international emergency.\n\nOne world, one media, one authority for development, one source of wealth, one international army. The construction of a \u201cjust society\u201d with political and social equality rather than a free society with the individual as the sole possessor of rights. The next step was to pull it altogether into a simple blueprint for implementation.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the UN sponsored a series of summits and conferences dealing with such issues as human rights, the rights of the child, forced abortion and sterilization as solutions for population control, and plans for global taxation through the UN.\n\nThroughout each of these summits, hundreds of Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worked behind the scenes to write policy documents pertaining to each of these issues, detailing goals and a process to achieve them. These NGO\u2019s are specifically sanctioned by the United Nations in order to participate in the process. The UN views them as \u201ccivil society, the non governmental representatives of the people. In short, in the eyes of the UN, the NGOs are the \u201cpeople.\u201d\n\nWho are they? They include activist groups with private political agendas including the Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, The Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation, Zero Population Growth, Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, the National Education Association, an d hundreds more. These groups all have specific political agendas which they desire to become law of the land. Through work in these international summits and conferences, their political wish lists become official government policy.\n\nIn fact, through the UN infrastructure the NGOs sit in equality to government officials from member nations including the United States. One of the most powerful UN operations is the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). Created in 1973 by the UN General Assembly, the UNEP is the catalyst through which the global environmental agenda is implemented. Virtually all international environmental programs and policy changes that have occurred globally in the past three decades are a result of UNEP efforts. Sitting in on UNEP meetings, helping to write and implement policy, along with these powerful NGOs are government representatives, including U.S, federal agencies such as the Department of State, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThis, then, is a glimpse of the power structure behind the force that gathered in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 for the UN-sponsored Earth Summit. Here, five major documents, written primarily by NGOs with the guidance and assistance of government agencies, were introduced to the world. In fact, these final documents had been first drafted and honed though the long, arduous series of international conferences previously mentioned. Now, at Rio, they were ready for adoption as a blueprint for what could only be described as the transformation of human society.\n\nThe five documents were: the \u201cConvention on Climate Change,\u201d the precursor to the coming Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, later adopted in 1997; the \u201cBiodiversity Treaty,\u201d which would declare that massive amounts of land should be off limits to human development; the third document was called the \u201cRio Declaration,\u201d which called for the eradication of poverty throughout the world through the redistribution of wealth; the fourth document was the \u201cConvention on Forest Principles,\u201d calling for international management of the world\u2019s forests, essentially shutting down or severely regulating the timber industry; and the fifth document was Agenda 21, which contained the full agenda for implementing worldwide Sustainable Development. The 300 page document contains 40 chapters that address virtually every facet of human life and contains great detail as to how the concept of Sustainable Development should be implemented through every level of government.\n\nWhat did the United Nations believe that process entailed? In 1993, to help explain the far-reaching aspects of the plan, the UN published \u201cAgenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet.\u201d Here\u2019s how the UN described Agenda 21 in that document: \u201cAgenda 21 proposes an array of actions which are intended to be implemented by every person on earth\u2026it calls for specific changes in the activities of all people\u2026Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all humans, unlike anything the world has ever experienced.\u201d I have never read a stronger, more powerful description of the use of government power.\n\nHowever, critics of our efforts against Agenda 21 rush to point out that Agenda 21 is a \u201csoft law\u201d policy \u2013 not a treaty that must be ratified by the U.S. Senate to become law. So it is just a suggestion, nothing to be afraid of. To make such an argument means that these critics have failed to follow the bouncing ball of implementation.\n\nFollowing the bouncing ball to implementation\n\nIt started when, at the Earth Summit, President George H.W. Bush, along with 179 other heads of state signed agreement to Agenda 21. One year later, newly elected President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order # 12852 to create the President\u2019s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD). The Council consisted of 12 cabinet secretaries, top executives from business, and executives from six major environmental organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, The Sierra Club, the World Resources Institute, and the National Wildlife Federation. These were all players in the creation of Agenda 21 at the international level \u2013 now openly serving on the PCSD with the specific mission to implement Agenda 21 into American policy.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the pages of the PCSD report entitled \u201cSustainable America: A new Consensus for the Future, it directly quotes the Brundtland Commission\u2019s report \u201cOur Common Future\u201d for a definition of Sustainable Development. That is about as direct a tie to the UN as one can get. The PCSD brought the concept of Sustainable Development into the policy process of every agencies of the US federal government\n\nA major tool for implementation was the enormous grant-making power of the federal government. Grant programs were created through literally every agency to entice states and local communities to accept Sustainable Development policy in local programs. In fact, the green groups serving on the PCSD, which also wrote Agenda 21 in the first place, knew full well what programs needed to be implemented to enforce Sustainable Development policy, and they helped create the grant programs, complete with specific actions that must be taken by communities to assure the money is properly spent to implement Sustainable Development policy. Those are the \u201cstrings\u201d to which we opponents refer. Such tactics make the grants effective weapons to insure the policy is moving forward.\n\nFrom that point, these same NGOs sent their members into the state legislatures to lobby for and encourage policy and additional state grant programs. They have lobbied for states to produce legislation requiring local communities to implement comprehensive development plans. Once that legislation was in place, the same NGOs (authors of Agenda 21) quickly moved into the local communities to \u201chelp\u201d local governments comply with the state mandates. And they pledged to help by showing communities how to acquire the grant money to pay for it \u2013 with the above mentioned strings attached.\n\nWe\u2019re told over and over again that such policies are local, state and national, with no conspiracy of ties to the UN. Really? Then how are we to explain this message, taken from the Federal Register, August 24, 1998, (Volume 63, Number 163) from a discussion on the EPA Sustainable Development Challenge Grant Program? It says, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Challenge Grant Program is also a step in Implementing \u2018Agenda 21, the Global Plan of Action on Sustainable Development,\u2019 signed by the United Stats at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. All of these programs require broad community participation to identify and address environmental issues.\u201d\n\nOr consider this quote from a report by Phil Janik, Chief Operating Officer of the USDA \u2013 Forest Service, entitled \u201cThe USDA-Forest Service Commitment and Approach to Forest Sustainability\u201d \u201cIn Our Common Future published in 1987, the Brundtland Commission explains that \u2018the environment is where we all live; and development is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode.\u201d In short, Janik was explaining to his audience (the Society of American Foresters) just where the Forest Service was getting its definition of Sustainable Development \u2013 the report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\nMeanwhile, the NGOs began to \u201cpartner\u201d with other governmental organizations like the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Governors Association, the National League of Cities, the National Association of County Administrators and more organizations to which elected representatives belong to, assuring a near that a near universal message of Sustainable Development comes from every level of government.\n\nAnother NGO group which helped write Agenda 21 for the UN Earth Summit was a group originally called the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). It now calls itself ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability. After the Earth Summit in 1992, ICLEI set its mission to move into the policy process of local governments around the world to impose Sustainable Development policy. It now operates in more than 1200 cities globally, including 600 American cities, all of which pay dues for the privilege of working with ICLEI. Like a cancer, ICLEI begins to infest the local government policy, training city employees to think only in terms of Sustainable Development, and replacing local guidelines with international codes, rules and regulations.\n\nSo it\u2019s true, there are no UN blue helmeted troops occupying city halls in America, and yes, the UN itself does not have enforcement capability for this \u201c:non-binding\u201d document called Agenda 21. However, it does have its own storm troopers in the person of the Non-governmental Organizations which the UN officially sanctions to carry on its work. And that is how Agenda 21, a UN policy, has become a direct threat to local American communities.\n\nWhy we oppose Agenda 21\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that we fight Agenda 21 because we oppose its policies and its process, not just its origins. Why do we see it as a threat? Isn\u2019t it just a plan to protect the environment and stop uncontrolled development and sprawl?\n\nAs Henry Lamb of Freedom 21 puts it, \u201cComprehensive land use planning that delivers sustainable development to local communities transforms both the process through which decisions that govern citizens are made, and the market place where citizens must earn their livelihood. The fundamental principle that government is empowered by the consent of the governed is completely by-passed in the process\u2026the natural next step is for government to dictate the behavior of the people who own the land that the government controls.\u201d\n\nTo enforce the policy, local government is being transformed by \u201cstakeholder councils\u201d created and enforced by the same NGO Agenda 21 authors. They are busy creating a matrix of non-elected boards, councils and regional governments that usurp the ability of citizens to have an impact on policy. It\u2019s the demise of representative government. And the councils appear and grow almost overnight.\n\nSustainablists involve themselves in every aspect of society. Here are just a few of the programs and issues that can be found in the Agenda 21 blueprint and can be easily found in nearly every community\u2019s \u201clocal\u201d development plans: Wetlands, conservation easements, water sheds, view sheds, rails \u2013 to- trails, biosphere reserves, greenways, carbon footprints, partnerships, preservation, stakeholders, land use, environmental protection, development, diversity, visioning, open space, heritage areas and comprehensive planning. Every one of these programs leads to more government control, land grabs and restrictions on energy, water, and our own property. When we hear these terms we know that such policy originated on the pages of Agenda 21, regardless of the direct or indirect path it took to get to our community.\n\nYou\u2019ll find Watershed Councils that regulate human action near every trickling stream, river, or lake. Meters are put on wells. Special \u201caction\u201d councils control home size, tree pruning, or removal, even the color you can paint your home or the height of your grass. Historic preservation councils control development in downtown areas, disallowing expansion and new building.\n\nRegional governments are driven by NGOs and stakeholder councils with a few co-opted bureaucrats thrown in to look good. These are run by non-elected councils that don\u2019t answer to the people. In short, elected officials become little more than a rubber stamp to provide official \u201capproval\u201d to the regional bureaucracy.\n\nBut the agenda outlined in Agenda 21 and by its proponents is a much bigger threat that just land use planning. They openly advocate massive reduction of human populations. Some actually call for as much as an 85% reduction in human populations in order to \u201csave the planet.\u201d David Brower of the Sierra Club said, \u201cChildbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license.\u201d The UN\u2019s Biodiversity Assessment says, \u201cA reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present North American material standard of living would be 1 billion.\u201d\n\nThey also openly advocate the destruction of modern society as Maurice Strong, the head of the Earth Summit said, \u201cIsn\u2019t the only hope for the planet that the industrial nations collapse? Isn\u2019t it our responsibility to bring that about?\n\nThis issue then is not about simple environmental protection and modern planning. It is about a complete restructuring of our society, our values and our way of life. They use as their model an urgency based on global warming and climate change, claiming there is no need for discussion on these dire issues. Yet science is showing more and more proof that there is no man-made global warming. Are we to completely destroy our society based on such a shaky foundation?\n\nAnd that is just what the proponents are rushing to do.\n\nBarack Obama has issued a flurry of Executive Orders to bypass the Congressional process and dictate sustainable policy. In 2011 Obama issued EO # 13575 creating the White House Rural Council. It brings together 25 Cabinet Secretaries to enforce multi-jurisdictional enforcement of farming virtually controlling every decision for food production. It is a major assault on American farm production intended to enforce Sustainable farming practices. In truth it will only lead to food shortages and higher prices as farmers have no ability to make a decision without the approval of 25 government agencies, working at cross purposes and causing chaos in farm production.\n\nOn May1, 2012, Obama issued EO # 13609, dictating that the government must enforce coordination of international regulatory policy. Those international regulatory policies are UN-driven and the basic translation means enforcement of Sustainable Development policy.\n\nBut, again, skeptics of our fears of Agenda 21 continue to argue that it is all voluntary and if the US or local governments want to enforce it they are free to do so \u2013 nothing to fear but ourselves. Well, even if that were true, that\u2019s all about to change. On June 15 \u2013 23, international forces are again converging on Rio for Rio+20. The stated intention is to complete the work they began in 1992.\n\nSpecifically called for is a UN treaty on Sustainable Development. If passed by the Senate and signed by the Obama Administration, that will eliminate any ambiguity about where the policy is coming from. Moreover, documents produced so far for the summit call for a global council, new UN agencies, budgets and powers, and \u201cgenuine global actions\u201d in every nation \u2013 to ensure \u201csocial justice,\u201d poverty eradication, climate protection, biodiversity, \u201cgreen growth,\u201d and an end to \u201cunsustainable patterns of consumption.\u201d Again, thousands of NGOs, diplomats and world leaders will spend a lot of money and time in the Rio+20 effort. Is it all just for fun, or does it have a purpose with strong consequences for our way of life?\n\nThe fact is, we fight Agenda 21 because it is all-encompassing, designed to address literally every aspect of our lives. This is so because those promoting Agenda 21 believe we must modify our behavior, our way of doing everyday things, and even our belief system, in order to drastically transform human society into being \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\nWe who oppose it don\u2019t believe that the world is in such dire emergency environmentally that we must destroy the very human civilization that brought us from a life of nothing but survival against the elements into a world that gave us homes, health care, food, and even luxury. Sustainable Development advocates literally hope to roll back our civilization to the days of mere survival and we say NO. Why should we? We have found great deception in the promotion of the global warming argument. We believe in free markets and free societies where people make their own decisions, live and develop their own property. And we fully believe that the true path to a strong protection of the environment is through private property ownership and limited government. Those who promote Agenda 21 do not believe in those ideals. And so we will not agree on the path to the future. And our fight is just that \u2013 a clash of philosophy. There is very little room for middle ground.\n\nThe United States has never been part of a global village in which rules for life have been handed down by some self-appointed village elders. We are a nation of laws that were designed to protect our right to our property and our individual life choices while keeping government reined in. We oppose Agenda 21 precisely because it represents the exact opposite view of government.\n\nPART 2\n\nAGENDA 21 CONSPIRACY THEORY OR THREAT\n\nPART 2 of 2\n\nby Tom DeWeese\n\nMay 21, 2012\n\nNewsWithViews.com\n\nThe five documents were: the \u201cConvention on Climate Change,\u201d the precursor to the coming Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, later adopted in 1997; the \u201cBiodiversity Treaty,\u201d which would declare that massive amounts of land should be off limits to human development; the third document was called the \u201cRio Declaration,\u201d which called for the eradication of poverty throughout the world through the redistribution of wealth; the fourth document was the \u201cConvention on Forest Principles,\u201d calling for international management of the world\u2019s forests, essentially shutting down or severely regulating the timber industry; and the fifth document was Agenda 21, which contained the full agenda for implementing worldwide Sustainable Development.

What are you so afraid of?\u201d\n\nAnd of course, the most often heard response \u2013 \u201cAgenda 21, what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nAnd after they have proudly stated these well thought out points, they arrogantly throw down the gauntlet and challenge us to \u201canswer these facts.\u201d\n\nWill one of these \u201cinnocent\u201d promoters of the \u201cAgenda 21 is meaningless\u201d party line, please answer the following: Well, first I have a few questions of my own that I would love to have answered.\n\nIf it all means nothing, why does the UN spend millions of dollars to hold massive international meetings in which hundreds of leaders, potentates and high priests attend, along with thousands of non-governmental organizations of every description, plus the international news media, which reports every action in breathless anticipation of its impact on the world?\n\nIt if all means nothing, why do those same NGO representatives (which are all officially sanctioned by the UN in order to participate) spend months (sometimes years) debating, discussing, compiling, and drafting policy documents?\n\nIf it all means nothing, why do leaders representing nearly every nation in the world attend and, with great fanfare, sign these policy documents?\n\nTime after time we witness these massive international meetings, we read the documents that result from them, and when we question their meaning or possible impact on our nation, we are met with a dismissive shrug and a comment of \u201coh, probably not much\u2026\u201d\n\nReally? Then why? Why the waste of money, time, and human energy? Could it be that the only purpose is to simply give diplomats, bureaucrats, and NGOs a feeling of purpose in their meaningless lives, or perhaps a chance to branch out of their lonely apartments? Or could it really be that these meetings and the documents they produce are exactly as we say they are \u2013 a blueprint for policy, rules, regulations, perhaps even global governance that will affect the lives, fortunes, property and futures of every person on earth? Which is it? You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nWhy the fear of Agenda 21?\n\nThose who simply read or quickly scan Agenda 21 are puzzled by our opposition to what they see as a harmless, non-controversial document which they read as voluntary suggestions for preserving natural resources and protecting the environment. Why the fear? What exactly bothers us so much?\n\nThe problem is, we who oppose Agenda 21 have read and studied much more than this one document and we\u2019ve connected the dots. Many of us have attended those international meetings, rubbed elbows with the authors and leaders of the advocated policies, and overheard their insider (not for public distribution) comments about their real purpose.\n\nHere are a few examples of those comments made by major leaders of this movement as to the true purpose of the policies coming out of these UN meetings:\n\n\u201cNo matter if the science of global warming is all phony\u2026climate change provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.\u201d\n\nChristine Stewart (former Canadian Minister of the Environment)\n\n\u201cThe concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.\u201d Report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\n\u201cRegionalism must precede globalism. We foresee a seamless system of governance from local communities, individual states, regional unions and up through to the United Nations itself.\u201d Report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\nAll three of these quotes (and we have many) indicate using lies and rhetoric to achieve their goals, and that those goals include the elimination of national sovereignty and the creation of a \u201cseamless system\u201d for global governance. Again, do these quotes have meaning and purpose \u2013 do they reveal the true thoughts of the promoters of these policies, or were they just joking?\n\nFor the past three decades through the United Nations infrastructure, there have been a series of meetings, each producing another document or lynchpin to lay the groundwork for a centralized global economy, judicial system, military, and communications system, leading to what can only be described as a global government. From our study of these events, we have come to the conclusion that Agenda 21 represents the culmination of all of those efforts, indeed representing the step by step blueprint for the full imposition of those goals. Here\u2019s just a sample of these meetings and the documents they produced:\n\nIn 1980, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt chaired the Commission on International Development. The document, or report coming out of this effort, entitled \u201cNorth-South: A program for Survival,\u201d stated \u201cWorld development is not merely an economic process, [it] involves a profound transformation of the entire economic and social structure\u2026not only the idea of economic betterment, but also of greater human dignity, security, justice and equality\u2026The Commission realizes that mankind has to develop a concept of a \u2018single community\u2019 to develop global order.\u201d\n\nThat same year Sean MacBride, a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize, headed up a commission on international communications which issued a report entitled \u201cMany Voices, One World: Towards a New, More Just and More Efficient World Information and Communication Order.\u201d The Commission, which included the head of the Soviet news Agency, TASS, believed that a \u201cNew World Information Order\u201d was prerequisite to a new world economic order. The report was a blueprint for controlling the media, even to the point of suggesting that international journalists be licensed.\n\nIn 1982, Olof Palme, the man who single-handedly returned Socialism to Sweden, served as chairman of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues. His report, entitled \u201cCommon Security: A Blueprint for Survival,\u201d said: \u201cAll States have the duty to promote the achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control\u2026\u201d The report went on to call for money that is saved from disarmament to be used to pay for social programs. The Commission also proposed a strategic shift from \u201ccollective security\u201d such as the alliances like NATO, to one of \u201ccommon security\u201d through the United Nations.\n\nFinally, in 1987, came the granddaddy commission of them all, The Brundtland Commission on Environment and Development. Headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Vice President of the World Socialist Party, the commission introduced the concept of \u201cSustainable Development.\u201d For the first time the environment was tied to the tried and true Socialist goals of international redistribution of wealth. Said the report, \u201cPoverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.\u201d\n\nThese four commissions laid the groundwork for an agenda of global control; A controlled media would dictate the flow of information and ideas and prevent dissent; control of international development manages and redistributes wealth; full disarmament would put the power structure into the hands of those with armaments; and tying environmentalism to poverty and economic development would bring the entire agenda to the level of an international emergency.\n\nOne world, one media, one authority for development, one source of wealth, one international army. The construction of a \u201cjust society\u201d with political and social equality rather than a free society with the individual as the sole possessor of rights. The next step was to pull it altogether into a simple blueprint for implementation.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the UN sponsored a series of summits and conferences dealing with such issues as human rights, the rights of the child, forced abortion and sterilization as solutions for population control, and plans for global taxation through the UN.\n\nThroughout each of these summits, hundreds of Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worked behind the scenes to write policy documents pertaining to each of these issues, detailing goals and a process to achieve them. These NGO\u2019s are specifically sanctioned by the United Nations in order to participate in the process. The UN views them as \u201ccivil society, the non governmental representatives of the people. In short, in the eyes of the UN, the NGOs are the \u201cpeople.\u201d\n\nWho are they? They include activist groups with private political agendas including the Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, The Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation, Zero Population Growth, Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, the National Education Association, an d hundreds more. These groups all have specific political agendas which they desire to become law of the land. Through work in these international summits and conferences, their political wish lists become official government policy.\n\nIn fact, through the UN infrastructure the NGOs sit in equality to government officials from member nations including the United States. One of the most powerful UN operations is the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). Created in 1973 by the UN General Assembly, the UNEP is the catalyst through which the global environmental agenda is implemented. Virtually all international environmental programs and policy changes that have occurred globally in the past three decades are a result of UNEP efforts. Sitting in on UNEP meetings, helping to write and implement policy, along with these powerful NGOs are government representatives, including U.S, federal agencies such as the Department of State, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThis, then, is a glimpse of the power structure behind the force that gathered in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 for the UN-sponsored Earth Summit. Here, five major documents, written primarily by NGOs with the guidance and assistance of government agencies, were introduced to the world. In fact, these final documents had been first drafted and honed though the long, arduous series of international conferences previously mentioned. Now, at Rio, they were ready for adoption as a blueprint for what could only be described as the transformation of human society.\n\nThe five documents were: the \u201cConvention on Climate Change,\u201d the precursor to the coming Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, later adopted in 1997; the \u201cBiodiversity Treaty,\u201d which would declare that massive amounts of land should be off limits to human development; the third document was called the \u201cRio Declaration,\u201d which called for the eradication of poverty throughout the world through the redistribution of wealth; the fourth document was the \u201cConvention on Forest Principles,\u201d calling for international management of the world\u2019s forests, essentially shutting down or severely regulating the timber industry; and the fifth document was Agenda 21, which contained the full agenda for implementing worldwide Sustainable Development. The 300 page document contains 40 chapters that address virtually every facet of human life and contains great detail as to how the concept of Sustainable Development should be implemented through every level of government.\n\nWhat did the United Nations believe that process entailed? In 1993, to help explain the far-reaching aspects of the plan, the UN published \u201cAgenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet.\u201d Here\u2019s how the UN described Agenda 21 in that document: \u201cAgenda 21 proposes an array of actions which are intended to be implemented by every person on earth\u2026it calls for specific changes in the activities of all people\u2026Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all humans, unlike anything the world has ever experienced.\u201d I have never read a stronger, more powerful description of the use of government power.\n\nHowever, critics of our efforts against Agenda 21 rush to point out that Agenda 21 is a \u201csoft law\u201d policy \u2013 not a treaty that must be ratified by the U.S. Senate to become law. So it is just a suggestion, nothing to be afraid of. To make such an argument means that these critics have failed to follow the bouncing ball of implementation.\n\nFollowing the bouncing ball to implementation\n\nIt started when, at the Earth Summit, President George H.W. Bush, along with 179 other heads of state signed agreement to Agenda 21. One year later, newly elected President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order # 12852 to create the President\u2019s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD). The Council consisted of 12 cabinet secretaries, top executives from business, and executives from six major environmental organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, The Sierra Club, the World Resources Institute, and the National Wildlife Federation. These were all players in the creation of Agenda 21 at the international level \u2013 now openly serving on the PCSD with the specific mission to implement Agenda 21 into American policy.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the pages of the PCSD report entitled \u201cSustainable America: A new Consensus for the Future, it directly quotes the Brundtland Commission\u2019s report \u201cOur Common Future\u201d for a definition of Sustainable Development. That is about as direct a tie to the UN as one can get. The PCSD brought the concept of Sustainable Development into the policy process of every agencies of the US federal government\n\nA major tool for implementation was the enormous grant-making power of the federal government. Grant programs were created through literally every agency to entice states and local communities to accept Sustainable Development policy in local programs. In fact, the green groups serving on the PCSD, which also wrote Agenda 21 in the first place, knew full well what programs needed to be implemented to enforce Sustainable Development policy, and they helped create the grant programs, complete with specific actions that must be taken by communities to assure the money is properly spent to implement Sustainable Development policy. Those are the \u201cstrings\u201d to which we opponents refer. Such tactics make the grants effective weapons to insure the policy is moving forward.\n\nFrom that point, these same NGOs sent their members into the state legislatures to lobby for and encourage policy and additional state grant programs. They have lobbied for states to produce legislation requiring local communities to implement comprehensive development plans. Once that legislation was in place, the same NGOs (authors of Agenda 21) quickly moved into the local communities to \u201chelp\u201d local governments comply with the state mandates. And they pledged to help by showing communities how to acquire the grant money to pay for it \u2013 with the above mentioned strings attached.\n\nWe\u2019re told over and over again that such policies are local, state and national, with no conspiracy of ties to the UN. Really? Then how are we to explain this message, taken from the Federal Register, August 24, 1998, (Volume 63, Number 163) from a discussion on the EPA Sustainable Development Challenge Grant Program? It says, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Challenge Grant Program is also a step in Implementing \u2018Agenda 21, the Global Plan of Action on Sustainable Development,\u2019 signed by the United Stats at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. All of these programs require broad community participation to identify and address environmental issues.\u201d\n\nOr consider this quote from a report by Phil Janik, Chief Operating Officer of the USDA \u2013 Forest Service, entitled \u201cThe USDA-Forest Service Commitment and Approach to Forest Sustainability\u201d \u201cIn Our Common Future published in 1987, the Brundtland Commission explains that \u2018the environment is where we all live; and development is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode.\u201d In short, Janik was explaining to his audience (the Society of American Foresters) just where the Forest Service was getting its definition of Sustainable Development \u2013 the report from the UN Commission on Global Governance.\n\nMeanwhile, the NGOs began to \u201cpartner\u201d with other governmental organizations like the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Governors Association, the National League of Cities, the National Association of County Administrators and more organizations to which elected representatives belong to, assuring a near that a near universal message of Sustainable Development comes from every level of government.\n\nAnother NGO group which helped write Agenda 21 for the UN Earth Summit was a group originally called the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). It now calls itself ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability. After the Earth Summit in 1992, ICLEI set its mission to move into the policy process of local governments around the world to impose Sustainable Development policy. It now operates in more than 1200 cities globally, including 600 American cities, all of which pay dues for the privilege of working with ICLEI. Like a cancer, ICLEI begins to infest the local government policy, training city employees to think only in terms of Sustainable Development, and replacing local guidelines with international codes, rules and regulations.\n\nSo it\u2019s true, there are no UN blue helmeted troops occupying city halls in America, and yes, the UN itself does not have enforcement capability for this \u201c:non-binding\u201d document called Agenda 21. However, it does have its own storm troopers in the person of the Non-governmental Organizations which the UN officially sanctions to carry on its work. And that is how Agenda 21, a UN policy, has become a direct threat to local American communities.\n\nWhy we oppose Agenda 21\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that we fight Agenda 21 because we oppose its policies and its process, not just its origins. Why do we see it as a threat? Isn\u2019t it just a plan to protect the environment and stop uncontrolled development and sprawl?\n\nAs Henry Lamb of Freedom 21 puts it, \u201cComprehensive land use planning that delivers sustainable development to local communities transforms both the process through which decisions that govern citizens are made, and the market place where citizens must earn their livelihood. The fundamental principle that government is empowered by the consent of the governed is completely by-passed in the process\u2026the natural next step is for government to dictate the behavior of the people who own the land that the government controls.\u201d\n\nTo enforce the policy, local government is being transformed by \u201cstakeholder councils\u201d created and enforced by the same NGO Agenda 21 authors. They are busy creating a matrix of non-elected boards, councils and regional governments that usurp the ability of citizens to have an impact on policy. It\u2019s the demise of representative government. And the councils appear and grow almost overnight.\n\nSustainablists involve themselves in every aspect of society. Here are just a few of the programs and issues that can be found in the Agenda 21 blueprint and can be easily found in nearly every community\u2019s \u201clocal\u201d development plans: Wetlands, conservation easements, water sheds, view sheds, rails \u2013 to- trails, biosphere reserves, greenways, carbon footprints, partnerships, preservation, stakeholders, land use, environmental protection, development, diversity, visioning, open space, heritage areas and comprehensive planning. Every one of these programs leads to more government control, land grabs and restrictions on energy, water, and our own property. When we hear these terms we know that such policy originated on the pages of Agenda 21, regardless of the direct or indirect path it took to get to our community.\n\nYou\u2019ll find Watershed Councils that regulate human action near every trickling stream, river, or lake. Meters are put on wells. Special \u201caction\u201d councils control home size, tree pruning, or removal, even the color you can paint your home or the height of your grass. Historic preservation councils control development in downtown areas, disallowing expansion and new building.\n\nRegional governments are driven by NGOs and stakeholder councils with a few co-opted bureaucrats thrown in to look good. These are run by non-elected councils that don\u2019t answer to the people. In short, elected officials become little more than a rubber stamp to provide official \u201capproval\u201d to the regional bureaucracy.\n\nBut the agenda outlined in Agenda 21 and by its proponents is a much bigger threat that just land use planning. They openly advocate massive reduction of human populations. Some actually call for as much as an 85% reduction in human populations in order to \u201csave the planet.\u201d David Brower of the Sierra Club said, \u201cChildbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license.\u201d The UN\u2019s Biodiversity Assessment says, \u201cA reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present North American material standard of living would be 1 billion.\u201d\n\nThey also openly advocate the destruction of modern society as Maurice Strong, the head of the Earth Summit said, \u201cIsn\u2019t the only hope for the planet that the industrial nations collapse? Isn\u2019t it our responsibility to bring that about?\n\nThis issue then is not about simple environmental protection and modern planning. It is about a complete restructuring of our society, our values and our way of life. They use as their model an urgency based on global warming and climate change, claiming there is no need for discussion on these dire issues. Yet science is showing more and more proof that there is no man-made global warming. Are we to completely destroy our society based on such a shaky foundation?\n\nAnd that is just what the proponents are rushing to do.\n\nBarack Obama has issued a flurry of Executive Orders to bypass the Congressional process and dictate sustainable policy. In 2011 Obama issued EO # 13575 creating the White House Rural Council. It brings together 25 Cabinet Secretaries to enforce multi-jurisdictional enforcement of farming virtually controlling every decision for food production. It is a major assault on American farm production intended to enforce Sustainable farming practices. In truth it will only lead to food shortages and higher prices as farmers have no ability to make a decision without the approval of 25 government agencies, working at cross purposes and causing chaos in farm production.\n\nOn May1, 2012, Obama issued EO # 13609, dictating that the government must enforce coordination of international regulatory policy. Those international regulatory policies are UN-driven and the basic translation means enforcement of Sustainable Development policy.\n\nBut, again, skeptics of our fears of Agenda 21 continue to argue that it is all voluntary and if the US or local governments want to enforce it they are free to do so \u2013 nothing to fear but ourselves. Well, even if that were true, that\u2019s all about to change. On June 15 \u2013 23, international forces are again converging on Rio for Rio+20. The stated intention is to complete the work they began in 1992.\n\nSpecifically called for is a UN treaty on Sustainable Development. If passed by the Senate and signed by the Obama Administration, that will eliminate any ambiguity about where the policy is coming from. Moreover, documents produced so far for the summit call for a global council, new UN agencies, budgets and powers, and \u201cgenuine global actions\u201d in every nation \u2013 to ensure \u201csocial justice,\u201d poverty eradication, climate protection, biodiversity, \u201cgreen growth,\u201d and an end to \u201cunsustainable patterns of consumption.\u201d Again, thousands of NGOs, diplomats and world leaders will spend a lot of money and time in the Rio+20 effort. Is it all just for fun, or does it have a purpose with strong consequences for our way of life?\n\nThe fact is, we fight Agenda 21 because it is all-encompassing, designed to address literally every aspect of our lives. This is so because those promoting Agenda 21 believe we must modify our behavior, our way of doing everyday things, and even our belief system, in order to drastically transform human society into being \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\nWe who oppose it don\u2019t believe that the world is in such dire emergency environmentally that we must destroy the very human civilization that brought us from a life of nothing but survival against the elements into a world that gave us homes, health care, food, and even luxury. Sustainable Development advocates literally hope to roll back our civilization to the days of mere survival and we say NO. Why should we? We have found great deception in the promotion of the global warming argument. We believe in free markets and free societies where people make their own decisions, live and develop their own property. And we fully believe that the true path to a strong protection of the environment is through private property ownership and limited government. Those who promote Agenda 21 do not believe in those ideals. And so we will not agree on the path to the future. And our fight is just that \u2013 a clash of philosophy. There is very little room for middle ground.\n\nThe United States has never been part of a global village in which rules for life have been handed down by some self-appointed village elders. We are a nation of laws that were designed to protect our right to our property and our individual life choices while keeping government reined in. We oppose Agenda 21 precisely because it represents the exact opposite view of government.\n\nPART 2\n\nAGENDA 21 CONSPIRACY THEORY OR THREAT\n\nPART 2 of 2\n\nby Tom DeWeese\n\nMay 21, 2012\n\nNewsWithViews.com\n\nThe five documents were: the \u201cConvention on Climate Change,\u201d the precursor to the coming Kyoto Climate Change Protocol, later adopted in 1997; the \u201cBiodiversity Treaty,\u201d which would declare that massive amounts of land should be off limits to human development; the third document was called the \u201cRio Declaration,\u201d which called for the eradication of poverty throughout the world through the redistribution of wealth; the fourth document was the \u201cConvention on Forest Principles,\u201d calling for international management of the world\u2019s forests, essentially shutting down or severely regulating the timber industry; and the fifth document was Agenda 21, which contained the full agenda for implementing worldwide Sustainable Development.

Elliott in their book \u201cImpeachable Offenses: The Case to Remove Barack Obama from Office.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, a Center for Immigration Studies report found that in 2013 the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, released violent criminals, including murderers, rapists, kidnappers and drug dealers.\n\nThe offenders were among the 36,007 criminal illegal aliens released last year who committed 87,818 crimes, including 15,635 for driving while intoxicated.\n\nGet \u201cImpeachable Offenses: The Case to Remove Barack Obama from Office,\u201d autographed, at WND\u2019s Superstore, at a special price just today.\n\nThe statistics shows ICE released illegals jailed for 9,187 dangerous drug infractions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 kidnapping convictions, 193 homicide convictions, 1,317 domestic violence convictions and 1,075 aggravated assault convictions.\n\nLast year, it was widely reported ICE, a section of the Department of Homeland Security, freed from prison 622 criminal immigrants, including 32 with multiple felony convictions.\n\nThe Obama administration initially blamed the controversial move on the budget sequester cuts.\n\nHowever, the releases were just the tip of the iceberg, documented Klein and Elliott in \u201cImpeachable Offenses,\u201d which was published last August.\n\nThe authors cited ICE documents that state more than 8,000 criminal illegal aliens were released between fiscal years 2009 and May 2011 alone.\n\nA full chapter in the book documents other ways Obama circumvented Congress to enact immigration reform, possibly violating the U.S. Constitution and committing potentially impeachable acts.\n\nICE statistics show the agency released 3,847 convicted criminal aliens in 2009, 3,882 in 2010 and 1,012 through part of 2011.\n\nA 2011 audit by the DHS inspector general further found 809 recidivist Level 1 illegal immigrant criminals eligible for deportation were released from California and Texas jails in 2009.\n\nICE defines Level 1 as the \u201cmost egregious criminal aliens, who pose a significant public safety risk.\u201d\n\nOffenses include homicide, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, threats, extortion, sex offenses, cruelty toward family, resisting an officer, illegal weapon possession, hit and run, and drug offenses accompanied by sentences of more than a year.\n\nWhy were the criminal illegals released? The audit blamed the actions on \u201cagent \u2018staffing challenges,\u2019\u201d such as vacancies and \u201cincreasing workload levels.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, the criminal illegals were automatically released after ICE failed to file the required \u201cdetainer\u201d paperwork within 48 hours of the apprehension. The notice declares ICE\u2019s intent to begin removal proceedings against the criminal illegal.\n\nThe government previously quietly conceded that released criminal illegals are responsible for new crime waves, report Klein and Elliott in the book.\n\nAn August 2012 Congressional Research Service report stated the \u201cdecision not to deport some arrested illegal immigrants enabled a crime wave.\u201d\n\nWhile no specific victims were publicly identified, the CRS reported illegal immigrants released from custody between 2008 and mid-2011 were \u201ccharged with 16,226 subsequent crimes, including 19 murders, 142 sex crimes and thousands of drunk-driving offenses, drug-crimes and felonies.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpeachable Offenses\u201d further documents ICE catch-and-release efforts in which large numbers of illegals, including criminals, are rounded up but only a tiny number are charged with crimes.\n\nAt the end of September 2011, for example, ICE arrested 2,900 illegal immigrants with criminal records coming from all 50 states and four territories.\n\nAll had at least one criminal conviction, and \u201cat least 1,282 had been convicted of multiple charges, and more than 1,600 had felony convictions including manslaughter, attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, drug trafficking, child abuse, sexual crimes against minors, and aggravated assault.\u201d\n\nMore than 25 percent of those caught were immigration fugitives. Another 386 had re-entered the U.S. illegally after being removed \u201cmultiple times.\u201d\n\nHowever, only 146 of those arrested during the 2011 sweeps were turned over for prosecution. Of the total arrested, 42 were identified as gang members.\n\nBook fuels national debate\n\nMSNBC reported Klein and Elliott\u2019s \u201cImpeachable Offenses\u201d fueled the national conversation to impeach Obama, while BuzzFeed.com reported the book \u201cushers in the Obama impeachment movement.\u201d\n\nThe book lays out the blueprint for impeaching Obama, alleging high crimes, misdemeanors, bribery and other offenses committed against the U.S. Constitution and the limitations on the executive office.\n\nThe Daily Mail of London has called the \u201cImpeachable Offenses\u201d \u201cexplosive,\u201d reporting the book contains a \u201csystematic connect-the-dots exercise that the president\u2019s defenders will find troublesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider this work to be the articles of impeachment against Barack Obama,\u201d stated Klein.\n\n\u201cEvery American, whether conservative or liberal, Democrat, Republican or independent, should be concerned about the nearly limitless seizure of power, the abuses of authority, the cronyism, corruption, lies and cover-ups documented in this news-making book,\u201d Klein said.\n\nThe authors stress the book is not a collection of generalized gripes concerning Obama and his administration.

The Article 32 procedure is the military equivalent of a civilian grand jury, except that the accused has quite a few more rights. Unlike a typical grand jury, the Article 32 is presented before a single hearing officer, not held in secret, allows defense counsel to be present and to cross-examine witnesses, and to call their own. All of this occurred at Bergdahl\u2019s hearing. Army prosecutors called Bergdahl\u2019s immediate chain of command to testify. They established that Bergdahl left his post without orders, but also that Bergdahl had been \u201cgreat\u201d soldier until his desertion. Bergdahl\u2019s former platoon leader testified that while he led exhausting patrols to find the soldier following his disappearance, this did not result in the loss of any other troops. Bergdahl\u2019s former company commander confirmed this. On cross-examination the platoon leader appeared to agree with Bergdahl\u2019s defense attorney that if the soldier had an attitude problem it was that he felt his superiors were not aggressive enough in fighting the Taliban.\n\nBack in 2014 Army investigating officer Major General Kenneth Dahl interviewed Bergdahl. As an active duty soldier Bergdahl could be ordered to sit down for the interview, but might have asserted his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination, and refused to answer General Dahl\u2019s questions. Press reports indicated that this did not happen, but also did not reveal the content of the interview. Since I found it hard to believe that Bergdahl\u2019s attorneys would allow him to speak to the investigating officer unless he essentially had nothing incriminating to say, I assumed he claimed to have no memory of the events that led to his capture by the Taliban, including deserting his Army post. I was wrong. Instead, Bergdahl did incriminate himself, explaining to Dahl that he abandoned his post, but did so because he felt that his superiors were incompetent. Bergdahl claimed that his intent was to hike the 19 miles between his observation post and the nearest forward operating base in order to inform higher ranking officers there of the situation back at his unit. Bergdahl left behind his own rifle, considered stealing another soldier\u2019s pistol but thought better of it, and set out unarmed on his mission. En route he was quickly and easily captured by the Taliban, and then held for five years until he was freed in a controversial exchange for five notorious Taliban terrorist commanders. Bergdahl\u2019s attorneys, led by the experienced civilian defense lawyer, Eugene Fidell, managed to present this account to the Article 32 hearing officer without calling their client to the stand and subjecting him to cross-examination. Instead, they called General Dahl who repeated Bergdahl\u2019s account, and added for good measure that he did not believe Bergdahl deserved to be imprisoned for his offenses. They also presented witnesses that testified as to Bergdahl\u2019s mistreatment by the Taliban, his suffering at their hands, and the permanent mental and physical injuries he sustained as a result. Overall, it appears that Fidell and his team of Army defense lawyers damaged the prosecution and laid the groundwork for a recommendation of leniency by the Article 32 hearing officer. The defense position is that Bergdahl left his post, but did not desert, since he was on he was on his way to another Army post, and planned to report there. Thus, at most according to the defense, he is guilty of AWOL, a much less severe offense than desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. It is not clear that the prosecution made a compelling case otherwise. The hearing officer\u2019s recommendation is not binding on the convening officer, General Robert Abrams, but carries great weight. All this was clever lawyering by Bergdahl\u2019s legal team. Presumably they allowed Bergdahl to convey his story to Dahl back in 2014 calculating that if Dahl bought it, he might recommend not going forward with the prosecution. That Fidell has been calling for the Army to release Dahl\u2019s investigative report, suggests that the general either made such a recommendation, or was extremely ambivalent about going forward. Even if, as was the case, the Army did move to prosecute, Fidell figured on calling Dahl to the stand as a way of having Bergdahl in effect \u201ctestify\u201d without risking a damaging cross-examination. All of this raises the question of whether or not anything Bergdahl told Dahl was in fact true. Unless Bergdahl is exposed to cross-examination, and perhaps even then, it might be pretty hard for the Army to rebut his account. But even if it is true, the Army should not accept that desertion (or leaving one\u2019s combat post) by soldiers who disagree with their \u201cincompetent\u201d commanders is a minor offense. Anyone who has been in any army knows that many, if not most soldiers at any given time believe their officers and NCOs to be incompetent fools. Not infrequently, this is true, as it has been throughout history. If it wasn\u2019t, there would be no great military novels or films, mostly written by former soldiers smarter and more eloquent than their former superiors. However, all militaries count on these \u201cfools\u201d to run the show, there being nobody else to do so. Were the Army to cut Bergdahl a break because he was also a fool to have left his post, it would be tantamount to sanctioning such action in the future, which undermines the very essence of military discipline. Lastly, is the uncomfortable but compelling suspicion that this entire fiasco is a setup that will allow the Army to escape the Bergdahl case without embarrassing President Obama, who not only traded the Taliban terrorists for the soldier, but feted his family and proclaimed him a hero. Watching relatively inexperienced Army prosecutors blow a case against accomplished civilian defense lawyers is not entirely unusual. As a young JAG officer I was perhaps so victimized myself, and definitely saw it occur in other cases. The old saying that military justice is like military music -- not particularly good -- has some basis in reality. But it is also possible that the Army deliberately made it easy on Fidell and his team, and seeing a shadow boxing loss at the Article 32 as a political win. Article 32 hearings are a good way for the military to dispose of cases that they don\u2019t like, since they give the appearance of having brought the manner to a mini-trial and are comparatively fair compared to civilian grand juries. At least as reported, Bergdahl\u2019s Article 32 doesn\u2019t appear to have made a good case against him for anything more than an AWOL charge, which I think would suit the Army just fine. It would allow the Army to dispose of the case through something less than a General Courts Martial, preserve Bergdahl\u2019s veteran benefits for his apparent physical and psychological disabilities, and not extend the matter into the election year, embarrassing Obama and his increasingly likely successor as Democrat nominee, Vice-President Biden.

Climate Change", "0% User Rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of a fence jumper causing publicity headaches for the White House, many in Washington expected the Department of Homeland Security to step up their game. After all, the guy they caught \u2013 42-year-old Omar Gonzalez \u2013 could well have done something disastrous in another scenario. Of course, keeping the White House secure is only one of many priorities for the Bush-created DHS, but it doesn\u2019t seem like the time is right to add additional duties to the beleaguered agency.\n\nEspecially when those additional duties will be focused not on terrorism, illegal immigration, or keeping the peace, but rather the nebulous threat of CLIMATE CHANGE. According to top agency officials, it is incumbent upon the DHS to protect the infrastructure of American cities from the effects of global warming.\n\nCaitlin Durkovich, the assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the department, said Thursday that DHS was shifting from a focus on protection to a focus on resiliency. That kind of shift makes sense when you\u2019re talking about ensuring American cities, bridges, and skyscrapers are up to the challenge of a major terrorist attack. It starts to make a little less sense when you\u2019re talking about \u201cclimate change.\u201d What exactly is the Department of Homeland Security preparing for? A nonsensical disaster of the Day After Tomorrow variety?\n\nIndeed, it sounds like that is what they\u2019re preparing for. As part of Durkovich\u2019s speech, she mentioned preparing coastal cities for rising sea levels, a phenomenon that is \u2013 as yet \u2013 still a matter of intense debate in the scientific community. There was also reference made to 2012\u2032s Superstorm Sandy, which caused billions of dollars worth of devastation in New England. While it\u2019s appropriate, perhaps, for DHS to be involved in modernizing American cities against the threat of such storms, to pretend like hurricanes are a product of climate change is just willful ignorance.\n\nAll things considered, this sounds like another excuse to keep tax dollars flowing to the Department of Homeland Security in a time when John Ashcroft isn\u2019t giving updates to the country every five minutes. In the years after 9/11, the DHS had the perception of being the most important federal agency in the land. Now that we\u2019ve put time and distance between ourselves and the worst terrorist attack in our nation\u2019s history, the department is rarely mentioned at all.\n\nObama is undoubtedly responsible for much of the DHS\u2019s low profile. Being a Bush creation, he would have naturally wanted to keep them out of the spotlight. His focus has never been homeland security, after all. Now that the DHS is ripe for budget cuts, it\u2019s time to make up some new duties for the agency that will ensure its survival over the next few decades. After all, whether it was created by a Republican or not, Democrats can\u2019t risk doing anything that might put tax dollars back in American pockets.\n\n\n\n\n\n"], ["https://www.teapartycommunity.com/blog/15155/why-obama-refuses-to-say-the-words-quot-radical-islam-quot/", "Why Obama refuses to say the words \"radical Islam\"  Tea Party Community", "Why Obama refuses to say the words \"radical Islam\"(Author Unknown, updates inserted)When you read this you will understand why Obama refuses to say the words \"radical Islam.\"Did you know that we now have a Muslim government?John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed in Saudi Arabia.Obama's top advisor, Valerie Jarrett, is a Muslim who was born in Iran where her parents still live.Hillary Clinton's top advisor, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother and brother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, Arif Aikhan, is a Muslim.Homeland Security Advisor, Mohammed Elibiary, is a Muslim.Obama advisor and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salam al-Marayati, is a Muslim.(9.9.14:Homeland Security Advisor Quits After 'Inevitable' Return of 'Caliphatet' Tweet http://conscores.org/miw6 Obama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of North America is a Muslim.Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is a Muslim.And last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama.It's questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when he was sworn in.

Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

Muslim, Jew & the Christian shall all gather here in Peace and Justice for God as a whole for the betterment of mankind as a whole. I thank you,\u201d the note read.\n\nIn reaction to the note, Johnson remarked that it \u201cwas in stark contradiction to what (Aziz) did in deed and statement,\u201d but he was thankful that he was able to create a plan and enact it to keep everyone safe.\n\nThe power of prayer is incredible, and it was shown with what happened between these two men. We all know the violent tendencies of the followers of Islam, yet through prayer, Johnson was able to keep them at bay.\n\nGod works in mysterious ways, and in this case, He was called upon and kept a church full of His people safe despite the imminent threat from a radical Islamist. It just goes to show you that when things are left in His hands, they\u2019ll always work out for the best.\n\n[H/T: TheBlaze]"], ["http://2ndamendmentfight.com/7-anti-gun-myths-that-need-to-be-debunked-immediately/", "7 Anti-gun Myths That Need To Be Debunked Immediately", "America\u2019s gun control debate is rife with myths and falsehoods. In the Information Age we often face a lot of misinformation, and gun control is unfortunately often the poster child of misinformation.Here are some of the ways you are being misled.\n\n1. \u201cAssault Weapons\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term \u201cassault weapon\u201d is a made-up political term. AR-15\u2019s are not military rifles; so unscrupulous politicians refer to them as \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons.\u201d \u2018Style\u2019 \u2013 as in cosmetic appearance \u2013 is the only true word in that description. The Military uses the M4A1 carbine rifle, which looks outwardly very much like an AR-15, but they do not have the same functionality; AR-15s are not machine guns, though the terminology used is meant to imply they are. Senator Diane Feinstein (R-Calif.) says AR-15\u2019s are designed for killing as many people in close quarters combat as possible, when in fact the AR-15 is an intermediate to distance rifle with a range of 400-600m. Feinstein and others claim AR-15\u2019s are not used for hunting; but in fact there are dozens of varieties of AR-15 used for hunting everything from varmint/small game to deer, elk, and dangerous game. The AR-15 is not the weapon of choice for most mass shooters according to James Alan Fox, a highly respected criminologist from Northeastern University in Boston; handguns are. In fact, rifle homicides comprise a very small amount of homicides, accounting for less than 3% of homicides (323 out of 12,664 in 2011) mass shootings or otherwise.\n\n2. \u201cHigh Capacity Magazines\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome politicians would have us believe that so-called \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are responsible for a wave of death sweeping the nation. Academic, scholarly research shows the vast majority of homicides average four shots with less than 10 shots fired. While the Aurora shooter infamously used a 100-round magazine drum, these are novelty items that are prone to jam. In fact, it did jam probably saving lives. But mass shooters don\u2019t need 100-round magazines to commit atrocity \u2013 the shooters at Virginia Tech and Columbine used 10-round magazines, they just brought a lot of them (17 and 13 respectively). James Alan Fox states mass shooters often meticulously plan their attacks in advance; a high capacity magazine ban will not deter them as Virginia Tech and Columbine illustrate.\n\n3. Gun Show \u201cLoophole\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral people, including President Obama have stated that 40% of guns were bought via \u201cgun show loopholes.\u201d This is not true. For one, the term \u201cgun show loophole\u201d implies that people are deviously getting around something when in actuality; it is just selling personal private property and is not illegal or nefarious. Additionally, private sales may not actually occur at a gun show at all. More important than loose terminology is that this claim is based on a study from 1994 of 251 people. The Washington Post evaluated this claim with the study\u2019s original authors and says the president distorted the truth. The actual range is 14%-22% with a plus or minus error margin of 6%. This means the final accurate range of this study is as low as 8%, but no more than 28%; neither figure is 40%. Further, it\u2019s implied that closing private sales would solve the issue of criminals obtaining guns; it doesn\u2019t. It fails to address illegal trafficking and straw man purchases. A Department of Justice study indicates that 78.8% of criminals get guns from friends or family (39.6%) or from the street/illegally (39.2%). To this point, the FBI states there are 1.2 million gang members in U.S. and that gangs illegally traffic guns as addition to narcotics.\n\n4. Mass Shootings Are Not Increasing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, Mother Jones and others have claimed that mass shootings are increasing. Once again not true. James Alan Fox\u2019s analysis of the Mother Jones\u2018 study indicates they left out mass murders which made it seem there was an increase after the Federal assault weapon ban expired (they\u2019ve updated their story since). Some mass murders receive more media attention than others, however the number has been consistently about 20 annually since 1976. The number dead from these mass shootings fluctuates from about 25 to 150, depending on the year (Fox\u2019s chart is shown above). In 2012, it was less than 100. Though tragic, this represents a fraction of 1% of homicides. In recent years, homicides by raw number peaked in 1991 at 24,700; it\u2019s dropped in half since, and the homicide rate per 100,000 people today is less than it was even in 1900 (see below).\n\n5. Anti-Gun Organizations Lump in Suicide & Injuries With Crime Data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a mass murder shooting anti-gun organizations like the Brady campaign inevitably call for gun restrictions; these organizations also cite gun violence data other than crime data to include suicides and injuries. This is misleading. Although accidents and suicide are public health concerns, it is disingenuous to include them with homicide in response to a horrific crime. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), suicide rates have crept up slightly 2000-2009, but are still lower than the rate per 100,000 from 1950-1990. It\u2019s not accurate to say guns contribute to suicide causal factors since the rate is lower now. And ultimately, legislation aimed to prevent crime by banning weapons and limiting magazine capacity has no reasonable connection to either suicide or accidents. We ought to compare apples to apples: suicide with suicide prevention, accidents with safety programs, and homicide with policy that would realistically reduce homicide.\n\n6. Too Many Are Being Killed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement is political gaming and wordplay. How many dead would be okay? Who wouldn\u2019t want less murder? Ideally, zero would be the goal, but that begs the question of how to prevent any tendency of violence in humans. This phrase is not only meaningless in terms of contributing to policy that achieves a positive end result, but also dangerous in that the appeal to emotion runs the risk of circumventing genuine solution in favor of sound byte. It makes sense to try to achieve goals with policies other than those proven to be ineffective, as the previous Federal assault weapons ban was. Lastly, homicides are at an all time low.\n\n7. False Zero-Sum Dichotomy \u2013 \u201cEither/Or\u201d:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamous anti-gun rights advocate New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, \u201cI want the Congress to have to stand up and say \u2018I\u2019m with the NRA and support killing our children\u2019, or \u2018No'\u201d (Time magazine, January 28, 2013, p.30). On CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan, Congressman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said, \u201cthe NRA is enablers of mass murder.\u201d This overly simplistic incendiary rhetoric does nothing to further our national discussion, and falsely frames the debate as a zero-sum, winner-take-all, \u2018either/or\u2019 proposition \u2013 either you hug a gun or hug a kid, but you couldn\u2019t possibly be for both gun rights and your child\u2019s safety. That is preposterous. The NRA is not \u201cthe gun industry,\u201d and preservation of the Second Amendment is not of interest only to gun manufacturers. Nearly half of NRA funding comes from individual donors. The NRA is comprised of average people who want safe neighborhoods, schools, and streets. Rather than offer ridiculous false dichotomy and grandstanding, we should be looking for genuine solutions.\n\nBONUS: We Need More Laws:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the granddaddy lie. We already have a lot of laws. It\u2019s illegal to kill your mom, steal a gun, take that gun onto school property, forcibly break and enter, and murder kids. We already have laws preventing mentally ill & felons from obtaining guns, and we have a background check system (NICS). The Sandy Hook shooter was denied to legally purchase a gun because of the NICS system. We tried a federal assault weapons ban (AWB) before. What we do need is better enforcement of existing laws. Congress has not fully funded NICS. Many states do not fully report felony and mental health data to NICS. The Justice Department only prosecutes a fraction of those who criminally falsify background check forms. We desperately need to engage in genuine discussion about real solutions to the violence problem. These solutions are not likely to yield instantaneous results, or win the next election cycle; yet it is what we would do if we were serious about addressing the issue. The underlying causes include: gang activity, which accounts for 48-90% of violent crime depending on jurisdiction; drug abuse, the single biggest predictor of violence with-or-without mental illness; concentrated urban population and poverty; and mental illness, including de-institutionalization, treatment and intervention, and other facets of mental health.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com.

Elliott in their book \u201cImpeachable Offenses: The Case to Remove Barack Obama from Office.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, a Center for Immigration Studies report found that in 2013 the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, released violent criminals, including murderers, rapists, kidnappers and drug dealers.\n\nThe offenders were among the 36,007 criminal illegal aliens released last year who committed 87,818 crimes, including 15,635 for driving while intoxicated.\n\nGet \u201cImpeachable Offenses: The Case to Remove Barack Obama from Office,\u201d autographed, at WND\u2019s Superstore, at a special price just today.\n\nThe statistics shows ICE released illegals jailed for 9,187 dangerous drug infractions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 kidnapping convictions, 193 homicide convictions, 1,317 domestic violence convictions and 1,075 aggravated assault convictions.\n\nLast year, it was widely reported ICE, a section of the Department of Homeland Security, freed from prison 622 criminal immigrants, including 32 with multiple felony convictions.\n\nThe Obama administration initially blamed the controversial move on the budget sequester cuts.\n\nHowever, the releases were just the tip of the iceberg, documented Klein and Elliott in \u201cImpeachable Offenses,\u201d which was published last August.\n\nThe authors cited ICE documents that state more than 8,000 criminal illegal aliens were released between fiscal years 2009 and May 2011 alone.\n\nA full chapter in the book documents other ways Obama circumvented Congress to enact immigration reform, possibly violating the U.S. Constitution and committing potentially impeachable acts.\n\nICE statistics show the agency released 3,847 convicted criminal aliens in 2009, 3,882 in 2010 and 1,012 through part of 2011.\n\nA 2011 audit by the DHS inspector general further found 809 recidivist Level 1 illegal immigrant criminals eligible for deportation were released from California and Texas jails in 2009.\n\nICE defines Level 1 as the \u201cmost egregious criminal aliens, who pose a significant public safety risk.\u201d\n\nOffenses include homicide, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, threats, extortion, sex offenses, cruelty toward family, resisting an officer, illegal weapon possession, hit and run, and drug offenses accompanied by sentences of more than a year.\n\nWhy were the criminal illegals released? The audit blamed the actions on \u201cagent \u2018staffing challenges,\u2019\u201d such as vacancies and \u201cincreasing workload levels.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, the criminal illegals were automatically released after ICE failed to file the required \u201cdetainer\u201d paperwork within 48 hours of the apprehension. The notice declares ICE\u2019s intent to begin removal proceedings against the criminal illegal.\n\nThe government previously quietly conceded that released criminal illegals are responsible for new crime waves, report Klein and Elliott in the book.\n\nAn August 2012 Congressional Research Service report stated the \u201cdecision not to deport some arrested illegal immigrants enabled a crime wave.\u201d\n\nWhile no specific victims were publicly identified, the CRS reported illegal immigrants released from custody between 2008 and mid-2011 were \u201ccharged with 16,226 subsequent crimes, including 19 murders, 142 sex crimes and thousands of drunk-driving offenses, drug-crimes and felonies.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpeachable Offenses\u201d further documents ICE catch-and-release efforts in which large numbers of illegals, including criminals, are rounded up but only a tiny number are charged with crimes.\n\nAt the end of September 2011, for example, ICE arrested 2,900 illegal immigrants with criminal records coming from all 50 states and four territories.\n\nAll had at least one criminal conviction, and \u201cat least 1,282 had been convicted of multiple charges, and more than 1,600 had felony convictions including manslaughter, attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, drug trafficking, child abuse, sexual crimes against minors, and aggravated assault.\u201d\n\nMore than 25 percent of those caught were immigration fugitives. Another 386 had re-entered the U.S. illegally after being removed \u201cmultiple times.\u201d\n\nHowever, only 146 of those arrested during the 2011 sweeps were turned over for prosecution. Of the total arrested, 42 were identified as gang members.\n\nBook fuels national debate\n\nMSNBC reported Klein and Elliott\u2019s \u201cImpeachable Offenses\u201d fueled the national conversation to impeach Obama, while BuzzFeed.com reported the book \u201cushers in the Obama impeachment movement.\u201d\n\nThe book lays out the blueprint for impeaching Obama, alleging high crimes, misdemeanors, bribery and other offenses committed against the U.S. Constitution and the limitations on the executive office.\n\nThe Daily Mail of London has called the \u201cImpeachable Offenses\u201d \u201cexplosive,\u201d reporting the book contains a \u201csystematic connect-the-dots exercise that the president\u2019s defenders will find troublesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider this work to be the articles of impeachment against Barack Obama,\u201d stated Klein.\n\n\u201cEvery American, whether conservative or liberal, Democrat, Republican or independent, should be concerned about the nearly limitless seizure of power, the abuses of authority, the cronyism, corruption, lies and cover-ups documented in this news-making book,\u201d Klein said.\n\nThe authors stress the book is not a collection of generalized gripes concerning Obama and his administration.

Unfortunately, no.\n\nThanks to a band of lawyers called Judicial Watch, and no thanks at all to the mainstream press, we are learning about a shady October 2010 meeting between former IRS official Lois Lerner, Justice Department officials and the FBI. It was at this gathering of minds, says Judicial Watch, that the parties planned \"for the possible criminal prosecution of targeted nonprofit organizations for alleged illegal political activity.\"\n\nRecords unearthed by Judicial Watch also document the IRS transferring confidential tax returns from 113,000 nonprofit social welfare groups to the FBI \"as part of its prosecution effort.\"\n\nThey also show \"the Obama DOJ wanted IRS employees who were going to testify to Congress to turn over documents to the DOJ before giving them to Congress.\"\n\nThis scandal has come quite a way since it was first confirmed nearly 800 days ago that IRS was targeting for added scrutiny conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. Harassing conservative and Tea Party organizations and holding up their paperwork are one level of misconduct.\n\nBut planning to send people to prison because they have different political views seems criminal itself.\n\nIt's unlikely anyone in this government will be convicted and sentenced for meeting to talk about charging interest groups with crimes. But there remains the fact that while Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chaired the House Oversight Committee, he sent a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen telling him that Lerner might have violated federal tax law when she transmitted those tax returns to the Justice Department.\n\nAt the very least, we should see a proper investigation into this charge.\n\nMeanwhile, as Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says, these new documents \"show that the Obama IRS scandal is also an Obama DOJ and FBI scandal.\"\n\nFrom what Fitton has seen, he believes \"the FBI and Justice Department worked with Lois Lerner and the IRS to concoct some reason to put President Obama's opponents\" in prison before his re-election.\n\nWhat would we do without Judicial Watch and its Freedom of Information Act lawsuits?\n\nClearly, the media haven't been terribly curious about the scandal. But that's no surprise, since Obama has been their darling since early 2008 and they will do whatever is necessary to protect him, including looking the other way at scandals that might hurt him.\n\nThough the Republicans appear curious, we really haven't seen much from them despite their control of the House since 2011 and the Senate since January.

AR-15\u2019s are not military rifles; so unscrupulous politicians refer to them as \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons.\u201d \u2018Style\u2019 \u2013 as in cosmetic appearance \u2013 is the only true word in that description. The Military uses the M4A1 carbine rifle, which looks outwardly very much like an AR-15, but they do not have the same functionality; AR-15s are not machine guns, though the terminology used is meant to imply they are. Senator Diane Feinstein (R-Calif.) says AR-15\u2019s are designed for killing as many people in close quarters combat as possible, when in fact the AR-15 is an intermediate to distance rifle with a range of 400-600m. Feinstein and others claim AR-15\u2019s are not used for hunting; but in fact there are dozens of varieties of AR-15 used for hunting everything from varmint/small game to deer, elk, and dangerous game. The AR-15 is not the weapon of choice for most mass shooters according to James Alan Fox, a highly respected criminologist from Northeastern University in Boston; handguns are. In fact, rifle homicides comprise a very small amount of homicides, accounting for less than 3% of homicides (323 out of 12,664 in 2011) mass shootings or otherwise.\n\n2. \u201cHigh Capacity Magazines\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome politicians would have us believe that so-called \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are responsible for a wave of death sweeping the nation. Academic, scholarly research shows the vast majority of homicides average four shots with less than 10 shots fired. While the Aurora shooter infamously used a 100-round magazine drum, these are novelty items that are prone to jam. In fact, it did jam probably saving lives. But mass shooters don\u2019t need 100-round magazines to commit atrocity \u2013 the shooters at Virginia Tech and Columbine used 10-round magazines, they just brought a lot of them (17 and 13 respectively). James Alan Fox states mass shooters often meticulously plan their attacks in advance; a high capacity magazine ban will not deter them as Virginia Tech and Columbine illustrate.\n\n3. Gun Show \u201cLoophole\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral people, including President Obama have stated that 40% of guns were bought via \u201cgun show loopholes.\u201d This is not true. For one, the term \u201cgun show loophole\u201d implies that people are deviously getting around something when in actuality; it is just selling personal private property and is not illegal or nefarious. Additionally, private sales may not actually occur at a gun show at all. More important than loose terminology is that this claim is based on a study from 1994 of 251 people. The Washington Post evaluated this claim with the study\u2019s original authors and says the president distorted the truth. The actual range is 14%-22% with a plus or minus error margin of 6%. This means the final accurate range of this study is as low as 8%, but no more than 28%; neither figure is 40%. Further, it\u2019s implied that closing private sales would solve the issue of criminals obtaining guns; it doesn\u2019t. It fails to address illegal trafficking and straw man purchases. A Department of Justice study indicates that 78.8% of criminals get guns from friends or family (39.6%) or from the street/illegally (39.2%). To this point, the FBI states there are 1.2 million gang members in U.S. and that gangs illegally traffic guns as addition to narcotics.\n\n4. Mass Shootings Are Not Increasing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, Mother Jones and others have claimed that mass shootings are increasing. Once again not true. James Alan Fox\u2019s analysis of the Mother Jones\u2018 study indicates they left out mass murders which made it seem there was an increase after the Federal assault weapon ban expired (they\u2019ve updated their story since). Some mass murders receive more media attention than others, however the number has been consistently about 20 annually since 1976. The number dead from these mass shootings fluctuates from about 25 to 150, depending on the year (Fox\u2019s chart is shown above). In 2012, it was less than 100. Though tragic, this represents a fraction of 1% of homicides. In recent years, homicides by raw number peaked in 1991 at 24,700; it\u2019s dropped in half since, and the homicide rate per 100,000 people today is less than it was even in 1900 (see below).\n\n5. Anti-Gun Organizations Lump in Suicide & Injuries With Crime Data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a mass murder shooting anti-gun organizations like the Brady campaign inevitably call for gun restrictions; these organizations also cite gun violence data other than crime data to include suicides and injuries. This is misleading. Although accidents and suicide are public health concerns, it is disingenuous to include them with homicide in response to a horrific crime. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), suicide rates have crept up slightly 2000-2009, but are still lower than the rate per 100,000 from 1950-1990. It\u2019s not accurate to say guns contribute to suicide causal factors since the rate is lower now. And ultimately, legislation aimed to prevent crime by banning weapons and limiting magazine capacity has no reasonable connection to either suicide or accidents. We ought to compare apples to apples: suicide with suicide prevention, accidents with safety programs, and homicide with policy that would realistically reduce homicide.\n\n6. Too Many Are Being Killed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement is political gaming and wordplay. How many dead would be okay? Who wouldn\u2019t want less murder? Ideally, zero would be the goal, but that begs the question of how to prevent any tendency of violence in humans. This phrase is not only meaningless in terms of contributing to policy that achieves a positive end result, but also dangerous in that the appeal to emotion runs the risk of circumventing genuine solution in favor of sound byte. It makes sense to try to achieve goals with policies other than those proven to be ineffective, as the previous Federal assault weapons ban was. Lastly, homicides are at an all time low.\n\n7. False Zero-Sum Dichotomy \u2013 \u201cEither/Or\u201d:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamous anti-gun rights advocate New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, \u201cI want the Congress to have to stand up and say \u2018I\u2019m with the NRA and support killing our children\u2019, or \u2018No'\u201d (Time magazine, January 28, 2013, p.30). On CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan, Congressman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said, \u201cthe NRA is enablers of mass murder.\u201d This overly simplistic incendiary rhetoric does nothing to further our national discussion, and falsely frames the debate as a zero-sum, winner-take-all, \u2018either/or\u2019 proposition \u2013 either you hug a gun or hug a kid, but you couldn\u2019t possibly be for both gun rights and your child\u2019s safety. That is preposterous. The NRA is not \u201cthe gun industry,\u201d and preservation of the Second Amendment is not of interest only to gun manufacturers. Nearly half of NRA funding comes from individual donors. The NRA is comprised of average people who want safe neighborhoods, schools, and streets. Rather than offer ridiculous false dichotomy and grandstanding, we should be looking for genuine solutions.\n\nBONUS: We Need More Laws:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the granddaddy lie. We already have a lot of laws. It\u2019s illegal to kill your mom, steal a gun, take that gun onto school property, forcibly break and enter, and murder kids. We already have laws preventing mentally ill & felons from obtaining guns, and we have a background check system (NICS). The Sandy Hook shooter was denied to legally purchase a gun because of the NICS system. We tried a federal assault weapons ban (AWB) before. What we do need is better enforcement of existing laws. Congress has not fully funded NICS. Many states do not fully report felony and mental health data to NICS. The Justice Department only prosecutes a fraction of those who criminally falsify background check forms. We desperately need to engage in genuine discussion about real solutions to the violence problem. These solutions are not likely to yield instantaneous results, or win the next election cycle; yet it is what we would do if we were serious about addressing the issue. The underlying causes include: gang activity, which accounts for 48-90% of violent crime depending on jurisdiction; drug abuse, the single biggest predictor of violence with-or-without mental illness; concentrated urban population and poverty; and mental illness, including de-institutionalization, treatment and intervention, and other facets of mental health.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com.

It is worth $300 to $700.\n\nThe White family told CBS2 the incident took place about 9 p.m. Thursday, and the drone landed right up near the top of the fire escape and some dormer windows.\n\nWhite\u2019s son, Ray, was asleep when the drone struck the house. But the ensuing commotion jolted him awake.\n\n\u201cIt was a big crash, they said, but I didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I came out and saw everything that happened.

Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

In fact, rifle homicides comprise a very small amount of homicides, accounting for less than 3% of homicides (323 out of 12,664 in 2011) mass shootings or otherwise.\n\n2. \u201cHigh Capacity Magazines\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome politicians would have us believe that so-called \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are responsible for a wave of death sweeping the nation. Academic, scholarly research shows the vast majority of homicides average four shots with less than 10 shots fired. While the Aurora shooter infamously used a 100-round magazine drum, these are novelty items that are prone to jam. In fact, it did jam probably saving lives. But mass shooters don\u2019t need 100-round magazines to commit atrocity \u2013 the shooters at Virginia Tech and Columbine used 10-round magazines, they just brought a lot of them (17 and 13 respectively). James Alan Fox states mass shooters often meticulously plan their attacks in advance; a high capacity magazine ban will not deter them as Virginia Tech and Columbine illustrate.\n\n3. Gun Show \u201cLoophole\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral people, including President Obama have stated that 40% of guns were bought via \u201cgun show loopholes.\u201d This is not true. For one, the term \u201cgun show loophole\u201d implies that people are deviously getting around something when in actuality; it is just selling personal private property and is not illegal or nefarious. Additionally, private sales may not actually occur at a gun show at all. More important than loose terminology is that this claim is based on a study from 1994 of 251 people. The Washington Post evaluated this claim with the study\u2019s original authors and says the president distorted the truth. The actual range is 14%-22% with a plus or minus error margin of 6%. This means the final accurate range of this study is as low as 8%, but no more than 28%; neither figure is 40%. Further, it\u2019s implied that closing private sales would solve the issue of criminals obtaining guns; it doesn\u2019t. It fails to address illegal trafficking and straw man purchases. A Department of Justice study indicates that 78.8% of criminals get guns from friends or family (39.6%) or from the street/illegally (39.2%). To this point, the FBI states there are 1.2 million gang members in U.S. and that gangs illegally traffic guns as addition to narcotics.\n\n4. Mass Shootings Are Not Increasing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, Mother Jones and others have claimed that mass shootings are increasing. Once again not true. James Alan Fox\u2019s analysis of the Mother Jones\u2018 study indicates they left out mass murders which made it seem there was an increase after the Federal assault weapon ban expired (they\u2019ve updated their story since). Some mass murders receive more media attention than others, however the number has been consistently about 20 annually since 1976. The number dead from these mass shootings fluctuates from about 25 to 150, depending on the year (Fox\u2019s chart is shown above). In 2012, it was less than 100. Though tragic, this represents a fraction of 1% of homicides. In recent years, homicides by raw number peaked in 1991 at 24,700; it\u2019s dropped in half since, and the homicide rate per 100,000 people today is less than it was even in 1900 (see below).\n\n5. Anti-Gun Organizations Lump in Suicide & Injuries With Crime Data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a mass murder shooting anti-gun organizations like the Brady campaign inevitably call for gun restrictions; these organizations also cite gun violence data other than crime data to include suicides and injuries. This is misleading. Although accidents and suicide are public health concerns, it is disingenuous to include them with homicide in response to a horrific crime. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), suicide rates have crept up slightly 2000-2009, but are still lower than the rate per 100,000 from 1950-1990. It\u2019s not accurate to say guns contribute to suicide causal factors since the rate is lower now. And ultimately, legislation aimed to prevent crime by banning weapons and limiting magazine capacity has no reasonable connection to either suicide or accidents. We ought to compare apples to apples: suicide with suicide prevention, accidents with safety programs, and homicide with policy that would realistically reduce homicide.\n\n6. Too Many Are Being Killed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement is political gaming and wordplay. How many dead would be okay? Who wouldn\u2019t want less murder? Ideally, zero would be the goal, but that begs the question of how to prevent any tendency of violence in humans. This phrase is not only meaningless in terms of contributing to policy that achieves a positive end result, but also dangerous in that the appeal to emotion runs the risk of circumventing genuine solution in favor of sound byte. It makes sense to try to achieve goals with policies other than those proven to be ineffective, as the previous Federal assault weapons ban was. Lastly, homicides are at an all time low.\n\n7. False Zero-Sum Dichotomy \u2013 \u201cEither/Or\u201d:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamous anti-gun rights advocate New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, \u201cI want the Congress to have to stand up and say \u2018I\u2019m with the NRA and support killing our children\u2019, or \u2018No'\u201d (Time magazine, January 28, 2013, p.30). On CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan, Congressman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said, \u201cthe NRA is enablers of mass murder.\u201d This overly simplistic incendiary rhetoric does nothing to further our national discussion, and falsely frames the debate as a zero-sum, winner-take-all, \u2018either/or\u2019 proposition \u2013 either you hug a gun or hug a kid, but you couldn\u2019t possibly be for both gun rights and your child\u2019s safety. That is preposterous. The NRA is not \u201cthe gun industry,\u201d and preservation of the Second Amendment is not of interest only to gun manufacturers. Nearly half of NRA funding comes from individual donors. The NRA is comprised of average people who want safe neighborhoods, schools, and streets. Rather than offer ridiculous false dichotomy and grandstanding, we should be looking for genuine solutions.\n\nBONUS: We Need More Laws:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the granddaddy lie. We already have a lot of laws. It\u2019s illegal to kill your mom, steal a gun, take that gun onto school property, forcibly break and enter, and murder kids. We already have laws preventing mentally ill & felons from obtaining guns, and we have a background check system (NICS). The Sandy Hook shooter was denied to legally purchase a gun because of the NICS system. We tried a federal assault weapons ban (AWB) before. What we do need is better enforcement of existing laws. Congress has not fully funded NICS. Many states do not fully report felony and mental health data to NICS. The Justice Department only prosecutes a fraction of those who criminally falsify background check forms. We desperately need to engage in genuine discussion about real solutions to the violence problem. These solutions are not likely to yield instantaneous results, or win the next election cycle; yet it is what we would do if we were serious about addressing the issue. The underlying causes include: gang activity, which accounts for 48-90% of violent crime depending on jurisdiction; drug abuse, the single biggest predictor of violence with-or-without mental illness; concentrated urban population and poverty; and mental illness, including de-institutionalization, treatment and intervention, and other facets of mental health.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com.

(AP Photo/Rob Griffith)\n\nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u2014 Australia's new Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull on Sunday announced sweeping changes to his first Cabinet and promoted more women, including Australia's first female defense minister.\n\nTurnbull increased the number of female Cabinet ministers from two to five, including Defense Minister Marise Payne.\n\nThe government's unpopular chief economics minister, Treasurer Joe Hockey, has been replaced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison.\n\nThe center-right government's popularity crashed in opinion polls and never recovered after Hockey unveiled his first annual budget in May last year. The budget was widely criticized as unfair toward the poor, and a hostile Senate blocked key measures.\n\nTurnbull, the former communications minister, replaced his predecessor Tony Abbott as prime minister in a surprise leadership vote of the ruling Liberal Party lawmakers on Monday night.\n\nIn challenging Abbott's leadership, Turnbull indirectly attacked Hockey with the criticism that \"the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need.\"\n\nTurnbull said Hockey would quit politics. Abbott was also excluded from the new 21-member Cabinet. Abbott's Cabinet had 19 ministers.\n\n\"Today I'm announcing a 21st century government and a ministry for the future,\" Turnbull told reporters. \"The changes I'm announcing are very extensive.\"\n\nAbbott was widely criticized for including only one woman in his first Cabinet in 2013, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the Liberal Party deputy leader. She was later joined by Health Minister Sussan Ley.\n\nBoth women retained their positions in Turnbull's Cabinet. They were joined by newcomers Payne, Minister for Women Michaelia Cash and Minister for Small Business Kelly O'Dwyer.\n\nTurnbull has also reintroduced a science minister, a portfolio scrapped by Abbott. Chris Pyne, the former minister for education and training, will become the minister for industry, innovation and science.\n\nThe new Cabinet will be sworn in on Monday.\n\nOutgoing Defense Minister Kevin Andrews, an Abbott ally who has been dumped from Cabinet, said he was disappointed that he did not keep the job he had held for only nine months.\n\n\"I am disappointed that Mr. Turnbull did not accept my offer to work with him,\" Andrews told reporters. \"Frankly, my remaining in this job was not about me, it was all about the stability of our Defense Force in Australia and its leadership.\"\n\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten welcomed what he described as an \"overdue increase in the number of women in the Cabinet.\""]]
