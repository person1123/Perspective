Last night Rachel Maddow revealed that the \u201cgroup\u201d is actually just one guy in South Dakota and that it has $30 in the bank. Raw Story recaps:\n\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow exposed the \u201cveterans group\u201d using an appearance by Donald Trump as a fundraiser on Tuesday as an apparent one-man organization. Trump\u2019s appearance aboard the USS Iowa, she explained, was an event benefiting Veterans for a Strong America, with tickets ranging between $100 and $1,000. However, Maddow said, the Federal Election Commission filings for the group\u2019s PAC reveal that, besides having only $30 cash in hand and $318 in debts, the organization\u2019s only member is founder Joel Arends. \u201cDonald Trump was not in the military, but he did use a pretty military backdrop tonight to raise money for a non-existent veterans\u2019 group, which endorsed him formally as part of his introduction \u2014 and he said they have hundreds of thousands of members,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t. And so the whole thing is fake.\u201d\n\nTrump has yet to acknowledge the scandal.\n\n"], ["http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/09/20/jackie-collins-best-selling-author-dies-age-77/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Pinknews+%28Pink+News%29", "Jackie Collins, best-selling author, dies age 77 \u00b7 PinkNews", "Best-selling novelist Jackie Collins has died at the age of 77.\n\nThe author lost a six-and-a-half year battle with breast cancer on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt is with tremendous sadness that we announce the death of our beautiful, dynamic and one of a kind mother, Jackie Collins, who died of breast cancer today,\u201d the Collins family said in a statement.\n\n\u201cShe lived a wonderfully full life and was adored by her family, friends and the millions of readers who she has been entertaining for over 4 decades.\n\n\u201cShe was a true inspiration, a trail blazer for women in fiction and a creative force.\n\n\u201cShe will live on through her characters but we already miss her beyond words.\u201d\n\nMs Collins was also a strong LGBT advocate \u2013 saying that many of her novels were inspired by the gay men in her life.\n\n\u201cIt may sound clich\u00e9, but some of my best friends are gay and I always have a better time with them than I do straight people,\u201d she told The Advocate in 2014.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve written gay characters into so many of my books.\n\n\u201cSome have bigger parts than others, but I like to write about all colours, all identities, all sexualities \u2013 gay, straight, whatever.\n\n\u201cI write characters that I see in my own life.\u201d\n\nHollywood actress Joan Collins led the tributes to her sister in a statement saying she was \u201ccompletely devastated\u201d by the loss.\n\n\u201cShe was my best friend,\u201d Joan said.\n\n\u201cI admire how she handled this.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.
