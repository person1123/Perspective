(ATI) at 12 mills in six states has entered its sixth week. ATI locked out workers on August 14 after rebuffing offers by the United Steelworkers (USW) union to hand over tens of millions of dollars in concessions, and after the USW ordered its members to continue to work past the June 30 contract deadline.\n\nThe locked-out workers are being deliberately isolated by the USW, which has ordered 30,000 workers at US Steel and ArcelorMittal to continue working without contracts after they expired on September 1.\n\nIn addition, 450 steelworkers at Sherwin Alumina in Gregory, Texas remain locked out after more than 11 months. This past week the USW offered more concessions to the aluminum producer, which rejected them because it is seeking even deeper cuts. While Sherwin Alumina has continued to operate the plant with scab labor, the USW has also left these workers completely isolated, holding only a few meaningless \u201csolidarity\u201d publicity stunts.\n\nATI is demanding steep increases in out-of-pocket health care expenses and the elimination of employer-paid pensions for new hires, creating a two-tier wage and benefits system. ATI wants to impose work rule changes that would essentially turn workers into casual laborers. In addition, ATI wants to vastly expand the use of outside contractors as a lower paid tier of workers that they can exploit even more ruthlessly than full-time employees.\n\nPicketers at ATI's Vandergrift mill from left to right: Janice with 10 years, Kathy Vargo, the wife of a recently-retired steelworker and Josh Fennell with 7 years\n\nJosh Fennell, a steelworker at ATI Vandergrift with seven years, noted the financial hardships imposed by an extended, isolated lockout. \u201cIt could go either way. It all depends on where people are financially. My wife works. We\u2019re going to be all right, the bills are going be paid. We\u2019re not going to do much else. Now, people we work with, some of them are the only source of income.\u201d\n\nJosh noted that he was forced into excessive overtime leading up the lockout. \u201cI did five or six hundred hours of overtime last year. Actually, I just looked at our last paycheck, and I\u2019m already at 300 this year. Before we got locked out, I was on 12-hour shifts. My last three weeks of work I was 76 hours, 72 hours, 78 hours.\u201d\n\nWorkers report that, thanks in large part to their forced overtime, ATI has stockpiled enough steel to last for months.\n\nJosh spoke of his opposition to ATI\u2019s concession demands. \u201cThe health care obviously is big, but all the news outlets are reporting that it\u2019s health care and health care only. It\u2019s far from that. I think a lot of the media is bought by the company. No doubt in my mind. You see a lot of media that way, they side with the company.\u201d\n\nJosh strenuously opposed lower pay and benefits for new hires, saying it would create a split between new and current workers. \u201cThey want to take away pensions from new hires and reduce them to strictly 401(k)s that they can keep when they leave the company. What\u2019s their incentive to actually stay? I have seven years in. I don\u2019t want to leave now because in 23 I can retire.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to say this [lockout] doesn\u2019t happen three or four contracts from now, and a worker says, \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing to lose, I\u2019ll see you later.\u2019 Then we\u2019re going to have less people fighting for their rights. On top of that if workers are divided new hires can say, \u2018Well, you didn\u2019t care about us.\u2019 It\u2019s not like that, however, a lot of us do care about the younger workers.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if ATI is bringing Strom Engineering scabs into the Vandergrift mill, Josh responded, \u201cYes they are, a white van just left. There\u2019s seven vans a day, seven a shift. They\u2019re not all full. Usually one of them is full and the others have two or three each.\u201d\n\nAsked what he thought of a united struggle of steel, auto and communication workers, Josh responded, \u201cOverall, I think this is the time where everybody needs to, for lack of a better term, fight the system. This is the chance, because we\u2019re all up right now. It couldn\u2019t have been a more opportune time to really go against the corporate greed of America.\u201d\n\nKathy Vargo, the wife of a recently retired steelworker who joined the picket line, said, \u201cI come here to show my support any time I can. My great grandmother marched with Fannie Sellins (a mineworkers organizer) who was murdered in 1919 near the plant gate in Brackenridge. There was a coal mine and the miners were on strike. Basically she was working to keep the Polish and Slovak women and families together with food and clothing so the men could strike. My great grandmother had come here to work in the mines too. She went to the gate and applied for the job by saying, \u2018Big hands, strong as a bull.\u2019 There she became active in the union.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on conditions at the Vandergrift mill, Kathy explained, \u201cLuckily my children are older, but for the last 15 years there has been no such thing as the eight hour day. The company was always forcing them to work overtime. You couldn\u2019t plan a birthday party or go to a school function because you didn\u2019t know if he would be home or not. I really feel for the young families because you can\u2019t have any kind of family life.\n\n\u201cThe company wants to go back to day labor, when they just hired you when they needed you. That was what my great grandmother was fighting against and we can\u2019t go back to that.\u201d\n\nJanice, with 10 years at the mill, said, \u201cI have one of the longest commutes of my coworkers. I am from the Mon Valley. I have been in manufacturing my whole life. When I graduated from high school in 1977, you could do whatever you wanted to do. If you wanted to be a steelworker, you could be a steelworker. If you wanted to be a coal miner, you could be a coal miner. If you wanted to be an autoworker, you could be an autoworker. The future was open.\n\n\u201cThat is all gone. The steel mills are all gone, construction is all gone. Anything that paid a good wage is gone. There are no jobs here. When I go home it is so sad that everything is boarded up. I am 56, I am a grandmother and I am concerned with the future of my grandchildren.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "As the Free Beacon reported:\n\nMedian household income declined to $53,657 in 2014, a figure 6.5 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the recession began, and 1.5 percent lower than last year, according to data released Wednesday from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2014, median household incomes declined by $3,700.

Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\"", "The U.S. Justice Department has awarded the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the official trade association of the firearms industry, $2.4 million for its \u201cProject ChildSafe\u201d program, which it says protects children by supplying gunlocks to households.\n\nGunlocks are important, but there are other giveaway programs the DOJ could support. Just as important is advancing gun safety policies, against which the NSSF has been one of the strongest opponents.\n\n\n\nAt a time when more than 20,000 children go to the emergency room every year with gun injuries, the NSSF has been forcefully advocating for loosening gun laws and getting firearms into as many hands as possible to expand gun sales. It opposes universal background checks, and works to \u201crebrand\u201d military-bred assault rifles like the AR-15 and AK-47 as \u201cmodern sporting rifles.\u201d Just this summer, it joined the NRA in suing Seattle over a sales tax on guns and ammunition designed to help offset the costs of gun violence in the city.\n\nBy giving public safety grants to NSSF, the DOJ only helps the gun industry project an image of being committed to gun safety, when in reality its top commitment is to expanding gun sales. In a nation where 33,000 Americans die each year from guns, our tax dollars should be spent supporting those working to reduce gun violence, not helping to facilitate it.", "GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina likes to portray herself as a hard-liner on Iran. However, during Fiornia\u2019s six-year tenure at Hewlett-Packard between 1999 and 2005, the company sold more than $100 million worth of computers and other high-tech equipment to Iranian customers, despite US export sanctions at the time. It\u2019s a small detail she has neglected to mention while on the campaign trail.\n\nHow did HP do it? The usual corporate schemes: the products were channeled through one of HP\u2019s European subsidiaries, and sold through an IT distributor in Dubai, known as Reddington Gulf. The sales continued long after HP sacked Fiorina. By 2007, more than 40% of printers sold in Iran bore the HP trademark.\n\nHP had started skirting Iran sanctions in 1997, two years before Fiorina came on board. By that time, sanctions imposed by the Clinton Administration had been in place for two years. However, there was a loophole in the law that allowed HP to do business in Iran \u201clegally,\u201d albeit indirectly. Under the rules in place at the time, foreign subsidiaries of American companies were considered outside of US jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the issue came to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2009 because of concerns that the equipment might be used for military or terrorism-related purposes. HP\u2019s legal department claimed that, because the subsidiaries were not \u201cUnited States [corporate] person(s),\u201d they were not subject to US sales restrictions.\n\nFiorina continued the HP scheme to get computers to Iran after she took over as CEO. Her compliance in violating US sanctions against Iran was highlighted in the Boston Globe in 2008 when Fiorina was attempting to unseat California Senator Barbara Boxer. The issue torpedoed her campaign then \u2013 and it could very well sink Fiorina again. Senator Boxer thought so when she told MSNBC: \u201cSo she\u2019s got so many problems. I say if the Republicans choose her, we\u2019ll walk into the presidency.\u201d\n\nDuring the first GOP debate, Fiorina declared that on her first day in office she would call Iranian leader Ali Khameni with the following message: \u201cUntil you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around.\u201d As CEO of Hewlett-Packard, however, Fiorina had no problem with Iran moving money into her own company\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt reminds us of another American businessman-turned Republican politician who got wealthy doing business with a government hostile toward the US. His name was Prescott Bush \u2013 and the country in which he was doing business was Nazi Germany.\n\nSome things never change\u2026", "By The Right Scoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio was on with Mark Levin tonight to talk Cuba and gave the best interview I\u2019ve heard yet on Cuba from anyone.

Rubio is really quite impressive in his knowledge of Cuba.\n\nHe also explains how bad the human rights situation is in Cuba, noting that basically the day before this deal was announced, the Cuban coast guard rammed a boat of migrants that was trying to escape Cuba and one of the passengers is still missing and presumed dead.\n\nAnd there\u2019s much more.\n\nThe interview runs almost 15 minutes but it\u2019s definitely worth listening to it in its entirety.\n\nListen:\n\n\n\n", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse.

Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base.

Soldiers who served in the same unit with him call him a deserter. The key to this deal, however, is less likely to be what the United States got out of the deal than it is about what Barack Obama got out of the deal. If nothing else, it instantly got the veterans' hospitals scandals off the front pages of newspapers and pushed these scandals aside on television news programs.\n\nIt was a clear winner for Barack Obama. And that may be all that matters to Barack Obama.\n\nPeople who are questioning the president's competence seem not to want to believe that any President of the United States would knowingly damage this country's interests.\n\nOne of the problems of many fundamentally decent people is that they find it hard to understand people who are not fundamentally decent, or whose moral compass points in a different direction from theirs.\n\nMany people who are painfully disappointed with President Obama have no real reason to be. The man's whole previous history, from childhood on, was shaped by a whole series of people, beginning with his mother, whose vision of America was very much like that of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, whose church Barack Obama belonged to for 20 long years.\n\nObama is not a stupid man. There is no way that he could have sat in that church all that time without knowing how Jeremiah Wright hated America, and how his vision of the world was one in which \"white folks' greed runs a world in need.\"\n\nEven if the Reverend Wright had been the only such person in Barack Obama's life -- and he was not -- it should have been enough to keep him out of the White House.\n\n\"Innocent until proven guilty\" is a good rule in a court of law, which has the power to deprive a defendant of liberty or life. But it is mindless and dangerous nonsense to apply that standard outside that context -- especially when choosing a President of the United States, who holds in his hands the liberty and lives of millions of Americans.\n\nPeople who are disappointed with Barack Obama have no right to be. It is they whom others have a right to be disappointed with. Instead of taking their role as citizens seriously, they chose to vote on the basis of racial symbolism, glib rhetoric and wishful thinking.\n\nMoreover, many are already talking about choosing the next President of the United States on the basis of demographic symbolism -- to have \"the first woman president.\" And if she is elected on that basis, will any criticism of what she does in the White House be denounced as based on anti-woman bias, as criticisms of President Obama have been repeatedly denounced as racism?\n\nAnd what if we have the first Hispanic president or the first Jewish president? Will any criticism of their actions in the White House be silenced by accusations of prejudice?\n\nWe may yet become the first nation to die from a terminal case of frivolity. Other great nations in history have been threatened by barbarians at the gates. We may be the first to be threatened by self-indulgent silliness inside the gates.\n\nAs for Barack Obama, you cannot judge any President's competence by the results of his policies, without first knowing what he was trying to achieve.\n\nMany wise and decent people assume automatically that President Obama was trying to serve the interests of America.\n\nFrom that standpoint, he has failed abysmally, both at home and abroad. And that should legitimately call his competence into question.\n\nBut what if his vision of the world is one in which the wealth and power of those at the top, whether at home or internationally, are deeply resented, and have been throughout his life, under the tutelage of a whole series of resenters?\n\nAnd what if his goal is to redress that imbalance?\n\nWho can say that he has failed, when the fundamental institutions of this country have been successfully and perhaps irretrievably undermined, and when the positions of America and its allies on the world stage have been similarly, and even more dangerously, undermined around the world?", "Educating Joe Nocera on the Fed, Job Killing, and the Export-Import Bank\n\nJoe Nocera seems to be obsessed with promoting the Export-Import Bank. Today he put out at least his fourth column on the topic, although this time he did refrain from calling his opponents \"idiotic.\"\n\nHis story is that Republican opponents of the bank are \"job-killers.\" (I'm not sure if this also applies to us non-Republican opponents.) Let's think this one through for a moment.\n\nThe basic story is that we have huge companies like General Electric and Caterpillar that get the vast majority of the subsidized loans from the Ex-Im Bank. Does that sound like handouts to huge companies? Nope, Nocera tells us just because these huge companies get all the money doesn't mean that they are the beneficiaries:\n\n\"'At a time when we want to compete around the world, it is hard to believe what is happening in the U.S. Congress,' said Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric.\n\n\n\n\"'The ultimate irony is that we are on the verge of an American manufacturing renaissance,' bemoaned Jim McNerney, the chairman of Boeing. 'Yet this action is causing companies to start looking outside the U.S. instead.'\n\n\n\n\"'People complain that the bank only helps big companies,' said Doug Oberhelman, the chairman and C.E.O. of Caterpillar. 'A lot of our suppliers are small. They don\u2019t export, but we do. And if we aren\u2019t exporting, they aren\u2019t selling to us.\u201d He added, \u201cI find it staggering that we would put highly paid export-oriented jobs at risk.'\n\n\"What Oberhelman finds 'staggering,' Immelt finds 'hard to believe' and McNerney finds ironic is the refusal of Republican extremists \u2014 led by the House Financial Services Committee\u2019s chairman, Jeb Hensarling \u2014 to allow a vote on the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a vote that would pass in a landslide.\"\n\nOkay, this argument has the form of the government should give me money because it is not really about helping me, I will spend the money on a car, on clothes, and on restaurant meals. If the government doesn't give me money, then I won't spend this money and all the people who would have been employed by this spending will be out of jobs. So it's really about helping them, not me.\n\nIt's not surprising that the CEOs of Boeing, General Electric, and Caterpillar would make this sort of argument. It is a bit surprising that an established columnist with the country's leading newspaper would take it seriously.\n\nBut let's get beyond the silliness and look more closely at the economics of the situation. Some folks may have heard of the Federal Reserve Board. They considered raising interest rates last week, but ultimately decided not to. Had the Fed actually raised rates the point would have been to slow the economy and reduce the rate of job creation. In other words, the Fed would be raising rates because it is worried that we will have too many jobs. (If you don't understand this point then you need to do more homework. This is why the Fed raises rates.)\n\nNow back to the Ex-Im Bank. Suppose that the Republicans in Congress read Nocera's column, realize their stupidity, and rush out and reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. Boeing, Caterpillar, and General Electric then use their subsidized loans to boost their exports. This lead to more people working at these companies and also at their smaller suppliers. Is everyone happy?\n\nNot quite.\n\nOur friends at the Fed see the uptick in employment. (Actually, it will probably be too small to have a noticeable impact in the data, but let's play along.) They decide that employment growth is definitely getting out of hand and start jacking up interest rates. This means less car buying, less home construction, less private investment, and less infrastructure investment by state and local governments. Also, higher interest rates are likely to lead to a higher dollar, which means fewer exports and more imports. Since the Fed has an idea of what employment levels and job growth rates they are willing to accept, any boost to employment that results from subsidized loans from the Ex-Im Bank is likely to be offset by the job losses resulting from higher interest rates.\n\nAre the jobs that are created by the subsidized loans to Boeing, Caterpillar, and General Electric better jobs than the ones lost in the auto sector, construction industry and other interest rate sectors of the economy? Offhand, I have no idea. But if Nocera or anyone wants to make a serious argument for the Ex-Im Bank, they have to be able to tell us why the jobs created by these subsidies are better than the jobs that they displace. Until they can make this case, they don't have an argument for reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, just a lot of name-calling.", "On Thursdays Show; Bear wonders how much crack you have to be smoking in order to think Tootsie is the greatest movie ever made?

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Scott Walker boasted that he \u201ctook on union bosses from Washington\u201d in his 2011 effort to crush state public-employee union rights.\n\nBut according to a stunning, detailed new statement by a former top Republican legislative aide, it turns out that Walker isolated himself and hid in tightly controlled, heavily-guarded environments during the conflict covering six intense weeks in early 2011\u2014which directly contradicts his tall tale of courageously facing his adversaries.\n\n\u201cOur unintimidated governor continued to only participate in private events with the media excluded or tightly controlled,\u201d wrote Michael Boerger, former top aide to retired Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis, in a September 10 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion piece.\n\nUnintimidated is the title of Walker\u2019s fact-challenged biography that recounts fiercely battling tens of thousands of pro-labor advocates as he pushed Act 10 into law. The legislation stripped most Wisconsin employees of any practical rights to union representation.\n\nWalker\u2019s reliance on his oft-told tale of political courage did not help deliver a breakout performance to counter his slipping poll numbers at Wednesday\u2019s debate. But Boerger\u2019s astonishing account of a man who hid from his critics and the public\u2014but later boasted of facing down enemies\u2014could mark a turning point for his 2016 ambitions.\n\nAs Boerger noted in his recent Milwaukee Journal Sentinel op-ed, while Walker sat quivering in fear, Madison police reported virtually no violence despite crowds of up to 150,000 protesters who stayed peaceful throughout the protracted battle over the legislation.\n\nWalker is a promoting a national anti-labor agenda as a cornerstone of his presidential campaign. In March, he signed a \u201cright-to-work\u201d bill for Wisconsin despite repeated assurances to the public and in private to conservative labor leaders that such a bill would never reach his desk. More recently, he has called for federal right-to-work laws, which discourage union membership and suppress wages, banning federal employee unions and closing the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nEven those who know Walker best are not impressed with his latest anti-union plans. Milwaukee\u2019s Journal Sentinel, a conservative paper which endorsed Walker three times for governor, dismissed his call for \u201cAct 10 nationwide\u201d and basically called him a serial liar.\n\n\u201cIt is more politicking from a governor who as recently as last year when running for re-election called right-to-work a distraction, then proceeded to sign the legislation anyway when it passed the Legislature,\u201d it editorialized. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growing distrust of Walker are Boerger\u2019s revelations that reveal Walker was hardly \u201cunintimidated\u201d in confronting unions. Last winter, candidate Walker ridiculously said that his battle with unionists showed that he could stand up to ISIS terrorists.\n\nWalker has also repeatedly said that he showed leadership by pushing Republican legislative leaders to fully support Act 10, which Boerger resented. His op-ed opened, \u201cAs a front-row witness to the sad history of the passage of Act 10, I have to refute the notion currently being advanced by Gov. Scott Walker that he faced stiff opposition to his proposal from GOP legislative leaders.\u201d\n\nBoerger\u2019s comments reflect the bitterness of Republicans who feel that they took the brunt of criticism from voters and were forced to engage in extraordinary anti-democratic tactics to prevent a high-profile loss for the new governor under an international spotlight\u2014as the Madison rebellion coincided with a popular uprising in Egypt and captured international headlines and TV coverage. Despite the GOP legislators\u2019 willingness to bend the rules to pass Act 10 for Walker, they saw themselves as unappreciated by the governor.\n\n\u201cEvery day that spring, legislators had to run a gantlet of protesters and meet in public in the Capitol for committee meetings and legislative sessions,\u201d stated Boerger. \u201cMeanwhile, our unintimidated governor was making speeches in minutely controlled, private venues that often even excluded attendance by the media.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Walker was so petrified of any direct challenge that he initially planned to deliver his high-profile budget address away from the State Capitol in a more tightly-guarded site, Boerger said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, the governor even planned to give his budget address outside the Capitol in such a private, security-dominated venue. Unintimidated? It was GOP leaders who convinced the governor to appear in public, in the statehouse as every other governor has done.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first account that has revealed Walker\u2019s self-described profile in courage as a big lie. While Republican legislators often faced protesters in heated dialogue as they circulated around the Capitol, Walker remained cloistered in his heavily-guarded office and \u201cslunk to and from the state Capitol via underground tunnels\u201d with armed escorts, Guardian journalist Jeb Lund reported.\n\nAs Walker\u2019s presidential ambitions keep floundering, it is beginning to appear that he is fated to return his bunker at the Capitol\u2014where he hid when he first launched his attack on labor and nurtured his presidential ambitions. But this time, he would be hiding from everyone who he used to fan his presidential ambitions.", "", "It's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

There is a segment of the population today that hates America, its people, and the nation\u2019s founding document, but instead of packing up and leaving the country, they have tasked Republicans to punish the entire population by legislating that all Americans suffer their lifestyle founded on poverty, bigotry, ill-health, and religious ignorance. Although there are Americans who hate this nation across the country, it is the former Confederacy that is punishing the people because they failed in their attempt to destroy America of their rejection of the United States Constitution they claim to love.\n\nSouthern states are still resentful they were unable to rip America apart because the Constitution forbade them from keeping dark-skinned human beings as livestock, so they spent the past 149 years punishing different groups of Americans based on their religion\u2019s instruction manual (Christian bible). Over the past thirty years, angry southerners began electing Republicans to strip everything from the people until they relented to a government by bible that drove their attempt to restrict other Americans from their Constitutional freedoms. Republicans have happily accommodated southerners to bring down the rest of the nation to their level of poverty and distress that southern red state voters embrace so long as they have imaginary enemies who believe Americans deserve more than slave wages, sickness, dire poverty, prayer, and firearms.\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge the former Confederacy considered owning human beings a biblically-supported and constitutional right according to their interpretation of the 10th Amendment. But even after losing the Civil War they persisted in targeting other groups for discrimination with biblical justification. Since their war against America, southern states opposed interracial marriage, women\u2019s right to vote, civil rights, voting rights, women\u2019s right to choose their reproductive health, and recently gay rights. The impetus for their opposition to those rights guaranteed in the Constitution is founded in their religion and since they were prohibited by the Constitution from depriving those groups of their rights, they have taken out their anger on the rest of the population by electing Republicans to Congress who promise to subject every American to conditions red southern state residents live under including poverty, slave wages, sickness and disease, and no hope of ever escaping their chosen lifestyle.\n\nIt is difficult for reasonable Americans to comprehend why voters in the South continue electing Republicans that campaign on perpetuating living conditions most Americans consider unacceptable. It is not because they believe all Americans live in poverty and love it, or that they are unaware their miserable plight is unavoidable. Most likely they are willing to live in poverty and ill-health with no chance of escaping because they are angry the rest of the nation will not tolerate their bigotry and hate; their only recourse is electing Republicans to legislate America into one big red state mired in bigotry, religion, guns, and deep poverty.\n\nAccording to The Department of Agriculture\u2019s measure of poverty, every red state from Arizona to South Carolina has the highest poverty rates in America; between 17.9% and 22.8%. The so-called bible belt is America\u2019s poverty belt including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, nearly one in four children trapped in Southern red states live in dire poverty and parents of those children elect Republicans to make those despicable statistics uniform across America. Part and parcel of conditions driving the South\u2019s poverty is low wages that voters elect Republicans to perpetuate across America.\n\nSouthern states are hostile to organized labor, five states have no state minimum wage, most are \u201cright to work for less\u201d states, and the 10 states with the lowest average incomes are in the former Confederacy including Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma according to the Equality of Economic Opportunity Project. Republicans in Congress promote policies that create poverty across the South and red state voters elect them anyway to subject the entire nation to low wages and the poverty they engender.\n\nThe depth of Southern voters\u2019 hatred for other Americans and their own families is evident in their support for Republicans that rejected expanding Medicaid in most of the South. According to a map by the Urban Institute, counties with the most people without healthcare insurance are in the Southern United States and it defies comprehension why voters support Republicans who prevent their children, parents, brothers and sisters from access to healthcare that does not cost states one cent for the first few years and only 10% (at most) thereafter. The same voters avidly oppose the Affordable Care Act that reveals they want tens-of-millions of Americans to suffer the same ill-health and disease they choose for their families.\n\nIt is unfathomable that residents in southern red states reject attempts to help them climb out of poverty and sickness, but religion and guns are powerful motivators for people still holding a grudge over being prevented from owning slaves, restricting women\u2019s rights, and discriminating against Americans according to their religious beliefs. It is no coincidence that the poorest Southern states are also the most religious and have the most firearm violence. In fact, the poorest states have the highest incidence of gun violence to go along with some of the highest gun ownership rates that Republicans take advantage of by joining the National Rifle Association fear mongering that President Obama is coming after their guns as fervently as he is coming after their religious liberty.\n\nMany pundits assert the conditions in southern red states are the fault of Republican-dominated legislatures, but without voters electing Republicans and teabaggers to preserve the deplorable conditions southern states would not lead the nation in poverty. Unfortunately, the same people electing Republicans at the state level vote for Republicans in Congress because they promise to oppose Democrats and President Obama\u2019s campaign to disarm Southern state residents\u2019 of their guns and bibles. It is certain that if President Obama and Democrats supported religious-driven bigotry and gun fanaticism, red southern state voters would reciprocate and support policies giving them decent wages, healthcare, and domestic programs to combat poverty. However, since that will never happen they will vote to elect Republicans to Congress to impose their deplorable living conditions on the entire population and spread their real America to every state in the Union.", "On Thursdays Show; Bear wonders how much crack you have to be smoking in order to think Tootsie is the greatest movie ever made?

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Across the country, 16 states offer in-state tuition discounts for illegal aliens: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington.

Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base.

While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke.

Soldiers who served in the same unit with him call him a deserter. The key to this deal, however, is less likely to be what the United States got out of the deal than it is about what Barack Obama got out of the deal. If nothing else, it instantly got the veterans' hospitals scandals off the front pages of newspapers and pushed these scandals aside on television news programs.\n\nIt was a clear winner for Barack Obama. And that may be all that matters to Barack Obama.\n\nPeople who are questioning the president's competence seem not to want to believe that any President of the United States would knowingly damage this country's interests.\n\nOne of the problems of many fundamentally decent people is that they find it hard to understand people who are not fundamentally decent, or whose moral compass points in a different direction from theirs.\n\nMany people who are painfully disappointed with President Obama have no real reason to be. The man's whole previous history, from childhood on, was shaped by a whole series of people, beginning with his mother, whose vision of America was very much like that of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, whose church Barack Obama belonged to for 20 long years.\n\nObama is not a stupid man. There is no way that he could have sat in that church all that time without knowing how Jeremiah Wright hated America, and how his vision of the world was one in which \"white folks' greed runs a world in need.\"\n\nEven if the Reverend Wright had been the only such person in Barack Obama's life -- and he was not -- it should have been enough to keep him out of the White House.\n\n\"Innocent until proven guilty\" is a good rule in a court of law, which has the power to deprive a defendant of liberty or life. But it is mindless and dangerous nonsense to apply that standard outside that context -- especially when choosing a President of the United States, who holds in his hands the liberty and lives of millions of Americans.\n\nPeople who are disappointed with Barack Obama have no right to be. It is they whom others have a right to be disappointed with. Instead of taking their role as citizens seriously, they chose to vote on the basis of racial symbolism, glib rhetoric and wishful thinking.\n\nMoreover, many are already talking about choosing the next President of the United States on the basis of demographic symbolism -- to have \"the first woman president.\" And if she is elected on that basis, will any criticism of what she does in the White House be denounced as based on anti-woman bias, as criticisms of President Obama have been repeatedly denounced as racism?\n\nAnd what if we have the first Hispanic president or the first Jewish president? Will any criticism of their actions in the White House be silenced by accusations of prejudice?\n\nWe may yet become the first nation to die from a terminal case of frivolity. Other great nations in history have been threatened by barbarians at the gates. We may be the first to be threatened by self-indulgent silliness inside the gates.\n\nAs for Barack Obama, you cannot judge any President's competence by the results of his policies, without first knowing what he was trying to achieve.\n\nMany wise and decent people assume automatically that President Obama was trying to serve the interests of America.\n\nFrom that standpoint, he has failed abysmally, both at home and abroad. And that should legitimately call his competence into question.\n\nBut what if his vision of the world is one in which the wealth and power of those at the top, whether at home or internationally, are deeply resented, and have been throughout his life, under the tutelage of a whole series of resenters?\n\nAnd what if his goal is to redress that imbalance?\n\nWho can say that he has failed, when the fundamental institutions of this country have been successfully and perhaps irretrievably undermined, and when the positions of America and its allies on the world stage have been similarly, and even more dangerously, undermined around the world?", "Pope Francis should tell victims of priest sex abuse and their families, and the entire church, that he will take necessary actions to right wrongs.\n\nTHERE was a time when I would have been among the throngs chanting \u201cViva la papa\u201d when Pope Francis arrives this week. However, as a survivor of priest sex abuse as a child, along with other survivors, I am experiencing very unsettling feelings about his presence in the United States. The pope symbolizes the dismal past and present response to the darkest era in the Catholic Church \u2014 that of sex crimes by clergy and the continued, systematic cover-up by bishops and popes.\n\nYes, Pope Francis is a breath of fresh air and brings a new tone. Taking care of our Earth is a worthy cause (\u201cOn Care for Our Common Home\u201d), and caring for the poor and downtrodden is admirable. Yet, I find that Francis is skirting an elephant that still remains largely unaddressed in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 2014, a Pew Research Center survey gave Pope Francis his lowest marks for not addressing priest sex abuse of children and adults. In the beginning of Pope Francis\u2019 reign in 2013, 70 percent of U.S. Catholics said that addressing the sex-abuse scandal should be \u201ca top priority\u201d for the new pope, far more than said the same about standing up for families and traditional moral values, spreading the Catholic faith or other issues.\n\nTo date, Pope Francis hasn\u2019t exposed one cleric who has committed or is concealing sex crimes. Nor has he ordered any of the world\u2019s 5,100 bishops to do so.\n\nFrancis is a powerful leader, able to make change quickly and effectively as he did in cleaning his own house, the Vatican, from corruption and financial mishandling. It really is time to address, once and for all, a major issue that still hangs as a dark cloud above the Catholic Church. Francis could put into effect immediate actions by ousting priests and bishops who cover up sex crimes. I propose five actions to get this done.\n\nStop immediately the transferring of proven or admitted priest sex offenders to poor countries to avoid criminal trial and consequences. Bishops have sent priest sex offenders who have exploited, raped and molested children to countries like Paraguay, Ecuador, Columbia, Brazil, Peru and Mexico. Pope Francis must stop this now from happening again, and he can.\n\nFrancis must defrock or demote, clearly and publicly, prelates who protect predators and endanger kids. An occasional quiet resignation and vague explanation, only after a massive diocesan scandal, isn\u2019t enough. That\u2019s been the pattern for centuries. And it doesn\u2019t deter cover-ups.\n\nFrancis must insist that bishops lobby for, not against, reforming secular child-safety laws, especially predator-friendly statutes of limitations that enable clerics who commit and conceal child sex crimes to stay hidden.\n\nFor the sake of public safety, Francis should order bishops to post on their websites the names of proven, admitted and credibly accused child-molesting clerics, along with their photos, whereabouts and work histories. (Under pressure, about 30 U.S. bishops have done this.)\n\nFrancis should demand that bishops turn over records about all accused child-molesting clerics to law enforcement. And he should do so with documents kept in the Vatican.\n\nIn short, I want Pope Francis to talk less and start doing, focusing on tangible, proven actions that protect kids by exposing predators and punishing enablers. Pope Francis, while he is in the United States, should tell survivors of priest sex abuse, their families and the entire Church what actions he plans to do now as the leader of the Catholic Church to right these wrongs. We deserve to know.\n\nNot looking us in the eyes as American Catholics next week and dealing with priest abuse and the cover-ups by bishops that is still going on today remains a major failing and weakness in an otherwise strong pope.", "Buy Photo Father Joseph Faraone greets worshipers before Mass in 2006 at St. Dennis Roman Catholic Church in East Fishkill.

Veterans suicide is out-of-control and military readiness is dangerously low, yet Obama is so obsessed with pandering to liberal interest groups he\u2019s nominated an openly gay civilian to run the Army. Homosexuality is not a job qualification. The U.S. military is designed to keep Americans safe and complete combat missions, not conduct social experiments.\n\nHuckabee said something similar last month when asked about transgender soldiers, because obviously allowing non-straight people to serve their country openly with honor and dignity is a \u201csocial experiment.\u201d\n\n[image via Christopher Halloran/Shutterstock]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "By Thomas Sowell - June 10, 2014\n\nPeople are arguing about what the United States got out of the deal that swapped five top level terrorist leaders for one American soldier who was, at best, absent from his post in a war zone. Soldiers who served in the same unit with him call him a deserter. The key to this deal, however, is less likely to be what the United States got out of the deal than it is about what Barack Obama got out of the deal. If nothing else, it instantly got the veterans' hospitals scandals off the front pages of newspapers and pushed these scandals aside on television news programs.\n\nIt was a clear winner for Barack Obama. And that may be all that matters to Barack Obama.\n\nPeople who are questioning the president's competence seem not to want to believe that any President of the United States would knowingly damage this country's interests.\n\nOne of the problems of many fundamentally decent people is that they find it hard to understand people who are not fundamentally decent, or whose moral compass points in a different direction from theirs.\n\nMany people who are painfully disappointed with President Obama have no real reason to be. The man's whole previous history, from childhood on, was shaped by a whole series of people, beginning with his mother, whose vision of America was very much like that of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, whose church Barack Obama belonged to for 20 long years.\n\nObama is not a stupid man. There is no way that he could have sat in that church all that time without knowing how Jeremiah Wright hated America, and how his vision of the world was one in which \"white folks' greed runs a world in need.\"\n\nEven if the Reverend Wright had been the only such person in Barack Obama's life -- and he was not -- it should have been enough to keep him out of the White House.\n\n\"Innocent until proven guilty\" is a good rule in a court of law, which has the power to deprive a defendant of liberty or life. But it is mindless and dangerous nonsense to apply that standard outside that context -- especially when choosing a President of the United States, who holds in his hands the liberty and lives of millions of Americans.\n\nPeople who are disappointed with Barack Obama have no right to be. It is they whom others have a right to be disappointed with. Instead of taking their role as citizens seriously, they chose to vote on the basis of racial symbolism, glib rhetoric and wishful thinking.\n\nMoreover, many are already talking about choosing the next President of the United States on the basis of demographic symbolism -- to have \"the first woman president.\" And if she is elected on that basis, will any criticism of what she does in the White House be denounced as based on anti-woman bias, as criticisms of President Obama have been repeatedly denounced as racism?\n\nAnd what if we have the first Hispanic president or the first Jewish president? Will any criticism of their actions in the White House be silenced by accusations of prejudice?\n\nWe may yet become the first nation to die from a terminal case of frivolity. Other great nations in history have been threatened by barbarians at the gates. We may be the first to be threatened by self-indulgent silliness inside the gates.\n\nAs for Barack Obama, you cannot judge any President's competence by the results of his policies, without first knowing what he was trying to achieve.\n\nMany wise and decent people assume automatically that President Obama was trying to serve the interests of America.\n\nFrom that standpoint, he has failed abysmally, both at home and abroad. And that should legitimately call his competence into question.\n\nBut what if his vision of the world is one in which the wealth and power of those at the top, whether at home or internationally, are deeply resented, and have been throughout his life, under the tutelage of a whole series of resenters?\n\nAnd what if his goal is to redress that imbalance?\n\nWho can say that he has failed, when the fundamental institutions of this country have been successfully and perhaps irretrievably undermined, and when the positions of America and its allies on the world stage have been similarly, and even more dangerously, undermined around the world?", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse.

Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "AP photo\n\nResidents of US liberal states search for psychologists on google 50 percent more as compared to residents of conservative states, Pravda.Ru reports.\n\nVermont has the most searchers for mental health help, at 74% greater than the national average, which makes sense, since it is a far-left state with a socialist Senator, Bernie Sanders, who likes to talk about the joys of rape.

Jindal said it wasn't a candidate's \"role\" to correct a questioner -- but also said he would have pointed out the U.S.'s anti-discrimination values.\n\nBut Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush emphatically said they believe Obama was born in the U.S. and criticized Trump for not standing up to the questioner.", "In 1998, David Mamet, the acclaimed playwright, published a short treatise, \u201cThree Uses of the Knife,\u201d on \u201cthe nature and purpose of drama.\u201d The book, based on lectures he delivered the previous year at Columbia University, is well regarded in the theatre world and among screenwriters for its philosophical approach to explaining what makes good drama. But Mamet\u2019s book also offers some shrewd observations on politics and serves as a useful tool for understanding the rise, and potential fall, of Donald Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, during the Republican Presidential debate on CNN, Trump was exposed as ignorant of basic policy details (he was a bystander during the foreign-policy exchanges), boorish (he refused to apologize to Columba Bush for saying that her background influenced Jeb\u2019s allegedly permissive views on undocumented immigrants), and he seemed\u2014no other way to put it\u2014\u201clow energy\u201d as the debate dragged on into its third hour. (As my colleague Amy Davidson put it, \u201che seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake.\u201d) Political observers then spent the day after the debate ruminating on whether we may be witnessing the beginning of Trump\u2019s decline, and whether his fate will look similar to that of the five Republican candidates\u2014Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum\u2014who all experienced similar polling surges in the 2012 G.O.P. Presidential contest, before Republican voters wised up and picked Mitt Romney.\n\nWhy did Trump\u2019s support shoot up to an average of almost thirty-five per cent in national polls? The (boring) political-science answer is that Trump\u2019s support was a function of his news coverage. His rise correlates perfectly with the amount of attention he received from the media. When voters, most of whom don\u2019t pay close attention to politics, are asked to choose from a long list of names, a third mention the one that they\u2019ve heard in the news most recently or most frequently.\n\nBut that explanation seems to leave a lot out. Why does the media cover Trump so much? Are voters, especially \u201cthe likely voters\u201d who are often polled, really that passive and ignorant? Why did they express increasingly positive views of him, as measured by favorability ratings, as the summer of Trump rolled on? How did Trump seize our attention?\n\nHe did it by stepping onto the summer stage in a way that none of his rivals did. The other Republican candidates spent 2015 attending to the traditional business of the so-called invisible primary: hiring staff, studying up on policy, building political networks in Iowa and New Hampshire, wooing elected officials whose endorsements might make a difference, and\u2014most of all\u2014courting donors.\n\nMost of the invisible primary is, well, invisible. Getting inside the rooms in New York and Miami and Dallas and Washington where the transactions of the invisible primary take place is nearly impossible. Sometimes good stories drip out, but they make for terrible TV. Meanwhile, much of the public portion of the invisible primary bores the media. Generally, the policy speeches and town-hall events in the early stages of the campaign are vague and uninteresting, as candidates resist taking firm and detailed positions on controversial topics for fear of opening themselves up to attacks later on.\n\nBut the political press demands drama. If it is not given a plot, it will create one. As Mamet argues, this is hardly unique to reporters. Humans are hardwired to turn mundane experiences into dramatic ones. \u201cIt is in our nature to dramatize,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe dramatize the weather, the traffic, and other impersonal phenomena by employing exaggeration, ironic juxtaposition, inversion, projection, all the tools the dramatist uses to create, and the psychoanalyst uses to interpret, emotionally significant phenomena.\u201d\n\nA political campaign that is organized around a drama has an immediate advantage over one that is not. Mamet argues, and he\u2019s right, that politics \u201csticks closer to traditional drama than does The Stage itself. A problem is stated, the play begins, the hero (candidate) offers herself as the protagonist who will find the solution, and the audience gives its attention.\u201d\n\nWhich of the candidates has done that this year? Trump\u2014and, to some extent, Bernie Sanders\u2014has provided a plot and fared well. Trump has identified a clear problem to which many Republican voters respond: America doesn\u2019t \u201cwin anymore.\u201d And he has offered a simple solution that only he can provide: Trump \u201cwill make America great again.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the problem and solution are laughably vague is a virtue. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has been forgettable exactly because she has insisted on promoting a myriad of highly specific solutions to very concrete problems before she has laid out the one big problem she wants to solve. (In fact, it\u2019s not so different from how Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign of \u201chope and change\u201d crushed Clinton\u2019s campaign of policy white papers.) Mamet argues that a politician \u201cwho promises drama and then delivers only social concern\u201d rarely excites the public. That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u201cessential to the healthy political campaign that the issues be largely or perhaps totally symbolic\u2014i.e. non-quantifiable.\u201d He recites a long list of slogans from recent American history, to which Trump\u2019s could easily be added: \u201cPeace with Honor, Communists in the State Department, Supply Side Economics, Recapture the Dream, Bring Back the Pride.\u201d The less detail, he argues, the more engaged the audience will be: \u201cA loose abstraction allows audience members to project their own desires onto an essentially featureless goal.\u201d\n\nTrump realized all of this, and he has had a great first act. But Wednesday night\u2019s debate suggested that he has no plan for a second act. First acts are famously easy to pull off. \u201cIt has often been remarked that anyone can write a good first act,\u201d Mamet notes. \u201cWhen the curtain goes up, we\u2019ve got your attention. So we dramatists don\u2019t have to do anything for a while. Later, either the plot will kick in or the audience will start yawning and eating popcorn.\u201d\n\nThe struggle of the second act in a political campaign, as in any drama, is that the problem identified at the beginning\u2014the one that seized our attention\u2014must be translated into the more mundane tasks that propel the protagonist toward his or her goal. Won\u2019t even the most committed Trump supporter start to wonder why this self-proclaimed savior hasn\u2019t prepared himself to answer standard policy questions? Will Trump build a staff and campaign infrastructure in Iowa and New Hampshire to handle all the dull mechanics of finding voters and getting them to the polls? Again, Obama\u2019s historic 2008 campaign is a good point of comparison: the vague promise of \u201chope and change\u201d was married to an enormously sophisticated national operation that tended to the mechanics of winning the delegates needed to capture his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nMamet illustrates second-act problems\u2014and their solutions\u2014by pointing to the real-life examples of political actors who actually changed history. The most ambitious and inspirational leaders are also the ones who, after articulating what seemed to be an impossibly lofty goal, soon found themselves mired in the tedious work required to realize it. \u201cIn the middle term the high-minded goal has devolved into what seem to be quotidian, mechanical, and ordinary drudgery,\u201d Mamet writes. Trump seems more ill-prepared to bother with the ordinary drudgery of politics than anyone in the race.\n\nPerhaps Trump can keep the first act going a little longer, but it is far more likely\u2014and the debate made it seem obvious\u2014that he hasn\u2019t a clue how to move beyond the bluster and bromides that initially seized our attention. The curtain may come down soon.", "At Wednesday night's debate, GOP front-runner Donald Trump once again repeated the totally discredited\u2014and incredibly dangerous\u2014theory that vaccines cause autism. You can watch it above. Basically, everything Trump said about vaccines was wrong. A lot of what his opponents said was wrong, too.\n\nWhat's more, this barrage of misinformation appears to have caused a massive increase in Google searches about the supposed vaccine-autism connection. The spike on the Google Trends chart below occurred shortly after the exchange:\n\n\"Autism has become an epidemic,\" Trump claimed. \"Twenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close. It has gotten totally out of control.\" Scientists dispute this: While it's true that autism diagnoses have risen, a recent study suggested that the number of children with autism symptoms has remained stable. In other words, autism may not be getting more common; we're just diagnosing it more often.\n\n\"I am totally in favor of vaccines,\" Trump insisted, before adding, \"but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time\u2026I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two- or three-year period of time. Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump\u2014I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child, and we've had so many instances, people that work for me. Just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\" By spreading out the vaccine schedule, Trump concluded, \"I think you're going to see a big impact on autism.\"\n\nVaccines do not cause autism. Spreading out vaccines over a longer time period won't make anyone safer, but it will put more children at risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, as my colleague Kiera Butler has explained. And those diseases can be deadly. \"When you delay vaccines, you increase the period of time in which you are susceptible to those diseases,\" vaccine expert Paul Offit told the New York Times Thursday. \"We are seeing the effects of that. The outbreak we saw this year in Southern California was among parents who had chosen to delay or withheld vaccines for their children.\"\n\nTwo of Trump's Republican rivals are doctors, but unfortunately they didn't clear up the issue.\n\n\"We have extremely well-documented proof that there's no autism associated with vaccinations,\" explained Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon. But, he added, \"it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.\"\n\nNo, it's not true.\n\n\"I'm all for vaccines, but I'm also for freedom,\" said Rand Paul, a former ophthalmologist. \"I'm also a little concerned about how they're bunched up. My kids had all of their vaccines, and even if the science doesn't say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to have the right to spread my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.\" Paul, who has previously suggested that vaccines can cause \"profound mental disorders,\" has been an outspoken opponent of proposals to strengthen vaccination mandates.\n\nFor his part, moderator Jake Tapper noted that \"the medical community adamantly disputes\" Trump's ideas about vaccines. But it's fair to assume that many people confused by this exchange immediately turned to the internet for more information. Fortunately, Google's top search results debunk Trump's theories, but you don't have to dig very far to find a number of websites promoting the vaccine-autism myth. After all, notorious vaccine critic Jenny McCarthy once explained that she began learning about autism at the \"University of Google.\"", "Justice Donald Trump Has A New Gun Plan, And It\u2019s Just As Crazy As You Think CREDIT: AP Photo/Mike Groll Donald Trump speaks during a gun rights rally at the Empire State Plaza on Tuesday, April 1, 2014, in Albany, N.Y.\n\nDonald Trump imagines a world where regular citizens can buy automatic weapons; where gun owners can hide their weapons in any state; where there are no expanded background checks for gun purchases; and where citizens fight crime with their own assault rifles.\n\nThat\u2019s at least according to Trump\u2019s position statement on guns, which he released on Friday. In it, the Republican presidential candidate laid out a vision on the Second Amendment similar to the one held by the National Rifle Association, which opposes new gun control measures and advocates instead for stricter enforcement of existing laws.\n\n\u201cThe Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThe right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.\u201d\n\nA few parts of Trump\u2019s statement focus on concealed carry, or the right for gun owners to walk around in public with their weapons hidden. He advocated for a federal law that mimicks a driver\u2019s license \u2014 in other words, if you get a concealed carry permit in one state, it should be enforceable in other states. Currently, there is no federal law addressing this \u2014 though all 50 states allow concealed carry with some type of permit, each permit has different terms, and is only enforceable in the state in which it was given.\n\nThis position is particularly personal to Trump. \u201cOur personal protection is ultimately up to us,\u201d his statement reads. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m a gun owner, that\u2019s why I have a concealed carry permit, and that\u2019s why tens of millions of Americans have concealed carry permits as well.\u201d\n\nPersonal protection was another theme of Trump\u2019s plan, which advocated \u201cempowering\u201d citizens to defend themselves and fight crime with their own weapons. \u201cHere\u2019s another important way to fight crime \u2014 empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves,\u201d his plan reads. \u201cLaw enforcement is great, they do a tremendous job, but they can\u2019t be everywhere all of the time.\u201d\n\nNot only does Trump want citizens to fight crime, but he wants them to have better, more powerful guns to do it.\n\n\u201cGun and magazine bans are a total failure,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOpponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like \u2018assault weapons,\u2019 \u2018military-style weapons\u2019 and \u2018high capacity magazines\u2019 to confuse people. What they\u2019re really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaw-abiding people should be allowed to own the firearm of their choice,\u201d he added. \u201cThe government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t totally new ground for Trump, who has been pro-gun for a long time. But he wasn\u2019t always against some of these restrictions. In 2000, Trump criticized Republicans for \u201cwalk[ing] the NRA line and refus[ing] even limited restrictions\u201d on guns. In the same year, he also said he supported banning assault weapons and expanding background checks. \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWith today\u2019s Internet technology we should be able to tell within 72-hours if a potential gun owner has a record.\u201d\n\nHis previous positions can be seen in Trump\u2019s own business dealings. A ThinkProgress investigation in August revealed that, despite Trump\u2019s current advocacy for gun-free zones, a number of Trump\u2019s hotels and golf courses are gun-free zones \u2014 even for guests with concealed-carry permits.\n\nInstead of placing restrictions on firearms or endorsement more stringent background checks, Trump\u2019s new plan focuses on expanding access to mental health care \u2014 though it does lack specifics on how much funds should be allocated, and what type of treatment programs should be focused on. Instead, it just says this: \u201cWe need to expand treatment programs, because most people with mental health problems aren\u2019t violent, they just need help.\u201d", "Yesterday Donald Trump held a fundraiser for a veterans group on the deck of the USS Iowa in California. Last night Rachel Maddow revealed that the \u201cgroup\u201d is actually just one guy in South Dakota and that it has $30 in the bank. Raw Story recaps:\n\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow exposed the \u201cveterans group\u201d using an appearance by Donald Trump as a fundraiser on Tuesday as an apparent one-man organization. Trump\u2019s appearance aboard the USS Iowa, she explained, was an event benefiting Veterans for a Strong America, with tickets ranging between $100 and $1,000.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "During the Republican debate Wednesday night, one of Jeb Bush\u2019s only applause lines came from countering an attack from Donald Trump on the presidency of George W.

This Pope has done more to take on the establishment he leads than any other Vatican leader in our lifetime. And he has done so with grace, energy, and determination. Our political leaders will all be there watching him. They should learn from him too.\n\nWhen I served in the heart of a Catholic village in Costa Rica as an environmental education Peace Corps Volunteer in the 1990's, I was new to the power of the Pope. At that time, Pope John Paul II was in the Vatican, and he set an example for the people I lived with and grew to love. They looked to him for guidance and were infused with energy from their Catholic faith.\n\nEvery morning I would hear the chants of the priests over the radio reciting morning prayers. I saw how the spirit of the village was infused with energy from their Catholic faith. It reminded me of my Jewish upbringing and the vitality that being Jewish has given me. It created a sense of community and shared values in the village, values that were inclusive and inspiring.\n\nThese values that guided my village friends were in many ways a product of the community's faith. They believed in supporting each other, in knowing their neighbors, in ensuring that everyone around them was cared for. They knew the earth around them as well, understanding how the mountains, streams, and wildlife both sustained and enriched their world.\n\nThat experience, where community values generated by faith in something bigger than oneself ruled the day, is what is creating such a buzz about the new Pope Francis. He exudes a devotion to the community and the natural world around us, and does so in a manner that is attractive to all of us. I see in him much of what I saw in that Central American village - a true desire to make the world a better place.\n\nWhich brings us back to the current crop of American politicians that the Pope will soon be addressing. The Pope strikingly stands for solutions that our Congressional leaders - and us by extension - would benefit from embracing.\n\nThink climate change. Think women's rights. Think economic equality. Think social tolerance. Think immigration. Think Iran and Middle East peace.\n\n\"Climate change is a global problem with grave implications...\" and that \"... there is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy.\"\n\n\"... Equal compensation for equal work,\" proclaiming \"... Why is it expected that women must earn less than men? No! They have the same rights. The disparity is a pure scandal.\"\n\n\"Working for a just distribution of the fruits of the earth and human labor is not mere philanthropy. It is a moral obligation. For Christians, the responsibility is even greater: it is a commandment.\"\n\n\"A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: 'Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?' We must always consider the person. Here we enter into the mystery of the human being.\"\n\n\"A change of attitude towards migrants and refugees is needed on the part of everyone, moving away from attitudes of defensiveness and fear, indifference and marginalization - all typical of a throwaway culture - towards attitudes based on a culture of encounter, the only culture capable of building a better, more just and fraternal world.\"\n\n\"May one cry rise up from every land, 'No' to war and violence and 'Yes' to dialogue and to peace. With war one always loses. The only way to win a war is never to wage it.\" \"The Holy See values positively this (Iran nuclear) agreement because it considers that the way to resolve disputes and difficulties should always be that of dialogue and negotiation... The full implementation of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) will ensure the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme under the NPT and will be a definitive step toward greater stability and security in the region.\"\n\nThe Pope understands that:Our Congress should recognize this and follow this lead. He has also loudly proclaimed that women's rights and equality must be demanded, such as when he calls for:And on economic equality, he is clear:The same goes for his belief in social tolerance for the LGBT community. For example, he once said:And on immigration he is clear:Likewise, on issues of war and peace, such as Iran and the Middle East, he has no reservations:\n\nOn all of these issues, the Pope stands for progress. These are values that not only he, but also the majority of Americans, believe in. But will our own Congress show enthusiasm for these views? Will they stand and applaud the community values that the Pope represents and calls for, or will they sit on their hands? Their actions will represent all of us to the world, and I pray that they do the right thing.\n\nBut I'm not holding my breath.\n\nMy guess is that the majority of the audience members will behave as they currently do when these issues are brought up: they will oppose them. My Costa Rican village friends will likely be watching the speech, and I'm sure that they will be saddened at such a response. And if this is what happens, we should make our voices heard, and demand that Congress truly listen to what the Pope has to say. It will be a clarifying moment indeed.", "Mike Huckabee isn\u2019t happy with President Obama\u2018s decision to appoint an openly gay man as the next Secretary of the Army.\n\nEric Fanning, the current acting Under Secretary of Army, was selected by Obama this week, which would make him the first openly gay man to lead any branch of the U.S. military.\n\nAnd while The Washington Post notes his sexuality isn\u2019t really a big deal to the Army or to even some Republicans in Congress, leave it to Huckabee to crank up the outrage-ometer with this statement today:\n\nIt\u2019s clear President Obama is more interested in appeasing America\u2019s homosexuals than honoring America\u2019s heroes.

However, during Fiornia\u2019s six-year tenure at Hewlett-Packard between 1999 and 2005, the company sold more than $100 million worth of computers and other high-tech equipment to Iranian customers, despite US export sanctions at the time. It\u2019s a small detail she has neglected to mention while on the campaign trail.\n\nHow did HP do it? The usual corporate schemes: the products were channeled through one of HP\u2019s European subsidiaries, and sold through an IT distributor in Dubai, known as Reddington Gulf. The sales continued long after HP sacked Fiorina. By 2007, more than 40% of printers sold in Iran bore the HP trademark.\n\nHP had started skirting Iran sanctions in 1997, two years before Fiorina came on board. By that time, sanctions imposed by the Clinton Administration had been in place for two years. However, there was a loophole in the law that allowed HP to do business in Iran \u201clegally,\u201d albeit indirectly. Under the rules in place at the time, foreign subsidiaries of American companies were considered outside of US jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the issue came to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2009 because of concerns that the equipment might be used for military or terrorism-related purposes. HP\u2019s legal department claimed that, because the subsidiaries were not \u201cUnited States [corporate] person(s),\u201d they were not subject to US sales restrictions.\n\nFiorina continued the HP scheme to get computers to Iran after she took over as CEO. Her compliance in violating US sanctions against Iran was highlighted in the Boston Globe in 2008 when Fiorina was attempting to unseat California Senator Barbara Boxer. The issue torpedoed her campaign then \u2013 and it could very well sink Fiorina again. Senator Boxer thought so when she told MSNBC: \u201cSo she\u2019s got so many problems. I say if the Republicans choose her, we\u2019ll walk into the presidency.\u201d\n\nDuring the first GOP debate, Fiorina declared that on her first day in office she would call Iranian leader Ali Khameni with the following message: \u201cUntil you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around.\u201d As CEO of Hewlett-Packard, however, Fiorina had no problem with Iran moving money into her own company\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt reminds us of another American businessman-turned Republican politician who got wealthy doing business with a government hostile toward the US. His name was Prescott Bush \u2013 and the country in which he was doing business was Nazi Germany.\n\nSome things never change\u2026", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse. Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

By 2007, more than 40% of printers sold in Iran bore the HP trademark.\n\nHP had started skirting Iran sanctions in 1997, two years before Fiorina came on board. By that time, sanctions imposed by the Clinton Administration had been in place for two years. However, there was a loophole in the law that allowed HP to do business in Iran \u201clegally,\u201d albeit indirectly. Under the rules in place at the time, foreign subsidiaries of American companies were considered outside of US jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the issue came to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2009 because of concerns that the equipment might be used for military or terrorism-related purposes. HP\u2019s legal department claimed that, because the subsidiaries were not \u201cUnited States [corporate] person(s),\u201d they were not subject to US sales restrictions.\n\nFiorina continued the HP scheme to get computers to Iran after she took over as CEO. Her compliance in violating US sanctions against Iran was highlighted in the Boston Globe in 2008 when Fiorina was attempting to unseat California Senator Barbara Boxer. The issue torpedoed her campaign then \u2013 and it could very well sink Fiorina again. Senator Boxer thought so when she told MSNBC: \u201cSo she\u2019s got so many problems. I say if the Republicans choose her, we\u2019ll walk into the presidency.\u201d\n\nDuring the first GOP debate, Fiorina declared that on her first day in office she would call Iranian leader Ali Khameni with the following message: \u201cUntil you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around.\u201d As CEO of Hewlett-Packard, however, Fiorina had no problem with Iran moving money into her own company\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt reminds us of another American businessman-turned Republican politician who got wealthy doing business with a government hostile toward the US. His name was Prescott Bush \u2013 and the country in which he was doing business was Nazi Germany.\n\nSome things never change\u2026", "West Valley, Utah-based SilencerCo started up in 2008, making a .22-caliber silencer called the Sparrow. Since acquiring South Carolina-based SWR (Southeastern Weaponry Research) Manufacturing in 2011, SilencerCo has become the largest maker of silencers in the U.S.It has been toying around with silencers for years, just waiting for an innovative idea that would put it on top. It has apparently found that product in the Maxim 9. The company's prototype is built partially on a Smith & Wesson M&P body, but Josh Waldron, SilencerCo\u2019s CEO, told Range365 that the guns coming out in 2016 will be designed and built completely by SilencerCo.Waldron added, \u201cTo make room for the suppressor we had to re-engineer everything. We are just working out the final details, which is why this won\u2019t be available until 2016.\u201d The company hopes to have the Maxim 9 out in time for the January 2016 Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade Show (SHOT Show).Even though Waldron didn't give out too many details about the unusual weapon, he did say, \"The Maxim 9 is a duty pistol, short, quiet, reliable, durable and can use any [9 mm] ammo.\" Supposedly, that's all a shooting enthusiast need to know.The Maxim 9 is not the first gun to be made with a built-in silencer. The High Standard HDM is a semiautomatic pistol equipped with an integral sound suppressor and was used during WWII by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Sturm, Ruger (RGR) currently produces them.Waldron points out that the maxim 9 is a much more powerful handgun than the .22-caliber silencer-handguns made by Sturm, Ruger, and he says this makes the Maxim 9 better suited for \"personal protection.\"There is a market for gun silencers today, and as a matter of fact, sales are booming. Despite tight gun-control restrictions, gun owners are willing to pay from $350 to $2,500 for silencers on the market. CNN Money is reporting the ATF's latest figures show the number of registered silencers jumped 38 percent year-over-year to 792,282 in February 2015.When the Maxim 9 goes on sale next year, it will be subject to the same federal laws that apply to silencers, or more accurately, suppressors. The noise is suppressed, but not altogether silenced. Suppressors are more vigorously regulated than most guns.Generally, a background check takes about 20 minutes. A photo ID is electronically submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by the gun shop, and if everything comes back OK, you're out of there. But buying a suppressor or any gun that falls under the National Firearms Act including full automatic machine guns and sawed-off shotguns is another matter.The buyer has to mail or fax a photo and fingerprints to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and pay a $200 tax. The wait for an answer can sometimes take as long as nine months, say WTVR.com. Suppressors are also subject to state law, and a few states have outlawed them. Suppressors are legal in 41 states, up from 37 a few years ago.", "During the Republican debate Wednesday night, one of Jeb Bush\u2019s only applause lines came from countering an attack from Donald Trump on the presidency of George W.

The article revealed that 50 intelligence analysts had formally complained that their reports about IS and al Nusra, an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group, were being altered by senior officials to downplay the groups\u2019 strength.\n\nHayes said that intelligence has been hidden and massaged by the Obama administration to downplay the strength of al Qaeda for years.\n\n\u201cMy argument is that this isn\u2019t a new scandal at all,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThere were games played with [the Osama bin Laden documents].

Scott Walker boasted that he \u201ctook on union bosses from Washington\u201d in his 2011 effort to crush state public-employee union rights.\n\nBut according to a stunning, detailed new statement by a former top Republican legislative aide, it turns out that Walker isolated himself and hid in tightly controlled, heavily-guarded environments during the conflict covering six intense weeks in early 2011\u2014which directly contradicts his tall tale of courageously facing his adversaries.\n\n\u201cOur unintimidated governor continued to only participate in private events with the media excluded or tightly controlled,\u201d wrote Michael Boerger, former top aide to retired Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis, in a September 10 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion piece.\n\nUnintimidated is the title of Walker\u2019s fact-challenged biography that recounts fiercely battling tens of thousands of pro-labor advocates as he pushed Act 10 into law. The legislation stripped most Wisconsin employees of any practical rights to union representation.\n\nWalker\u2019s reliance on his oft-told tale of political courage did not help deliver a breakout performance to counter his slipping poll numbers at Wednesday\u2019s debate. But Boerger\u2019s astonishing account of a man who hid from his critics and the public\u2014but later boasted of facing down enemies\u2014could mark a turning point for his 2016 ambitions.\n\nAs Boerger noted in his recent Milwaukee Journal Sentinel op-ed, while Walker sat quivering in fear, Madison police reported virtually no violence despite crowds of up to 150,000 protesters who stayed peaceful throughout the protracted battle over the legislation.\n\nWalker is a promoting a national anti-labor agenda as a cornerstone of his presidential campaign. In March, he signed a \u201cright-to-work\u201d bill for Wisconsin despite repeated assurances to the public and in private to conservative labor leaders that such a bill would never reach his desk. More recently, he has called for federal right-to-work laws, which discourage union membership and suppress wages, banning federal employee unions and closing the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nEven those who know Walker best are not impressed with his latest anti-union plans. Milwaukee\u2019s Journal Sentinel, a conservative paper which endorsed Walker three times for governor, dismissed his call for \u201cAct 10 nationwide\u201d and basically called him a serial liar.\n\n\u201cIt is more politicking from a governor who as recently as last year when running for re-election called right-to-work a distraction, then proceeded to sign the legislation anyway when it passed the Legislature,\u201d it editorialized. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growing distrust of Walker are Boerger\u2019s revelations that reveal Walker was hardly \u201cunintimidated\u201d in confronting unions. Last winter, candidate Walker ridiculously said that his battle with unionists showed that he could stand up to ISIS terrorists.\n\nWalker has also repeatedly said that he showed leadership by pushing Republican legislative leaders to fully support Act 10, which Boerger resented. His op-ed opened, \u201cAs a front-row witness to the sad history of the passage of Act 10, I have to refute the notion currently being advanced by Gov. Scott Walker that he faced stiff opposition to his proposal from GOP legislative leaders.\u201d\n\nBoerger\u2019s comments reflect the bitterness of Republicans who feel that they took the brunt of criticism from voters and were forced to engage in extraordinary anti-democratic tactics to prevent a high-profile loss for the new governor under an international spotlight\u2014as the Madison rebellion coincided with a popular uprising in Egypt and captured international headlines and TV coverage. Despite the GOP legislators\u2019 willingness to bend the rules to pass Act 10 for Walker, they saw themselves as unappreciated by the governor.\n\n\u201cEvery day that spring, legislators had to run a gantlet of protesters and meet in public in the Capitol for committee meetings and legislative sessions,\u201d stated Boerger. \u201cMeanwhile, our unintimidated governor was making speeches in minutely controlled, private venues that often even excluded attendance by the media.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Walker was so petrified of any direct challenge that he initially planned to deliver his high-profile budget address away from the State Capitol in a more tightly-guarded site, Boerger said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, the governor even planned to give his budget address outside the Capitol in such a private, security-dominated venue. Unintimidated? It was GOP leaders who convinced the governor to appear in public, in the statehouse as every other governor has done.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first account that has revealed Walker\u2019s self-described profile in courage as a big lie. While Republican legislators often faced protesters in heated dialogue as they circulated around the Capitol, Walker remained cloistered in his heavily-guarded office and \u201cslunk to and from the state Capitol via underground tunnels\u201d with armed escorts, Guardian journalist Jeb Lund reported.\n\nAs Walker\u2019s presidential ambitions keep floundering, it is beginning to appear that he is fated to return his bunker at the Capitol\u2014where he hid when he first launched his attack on labor and nurtured his presidential ambitions. But this time, he would be hiding from everyone who he used to fan his presidential ambitions.", "", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

School officials reported the clock as a \"hoax bomb,\" and called the local police. Five police officers handcuffed the child and brought him to a juvenile detention center, where he was finger-printed and interrogated before being released to his parents. Two days later, the Irving Police Department announced that Ahmed was no longer facing criminal charges, but the boy continued to serve out a three-day suspension from school for the creation of a so-called \"hoax bomb.\" The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is currently investigating the incident.

After the story of Ahmed's arrest was reported, it gained widespread public attention on social media. President Obama tweeted Ahmed an invitation to the White House, Hillary Clinton, Arne Duncan, and Mark Zuckerberg expressed their support, and Ahmed was offered an internship at Twitter. Well-wishers tweeted their support for Ahmed using the hashtag #IStandWithAhmed. A question about Ahmed's arrest was also featured at the earlier GOP debate on CNN Wednesday night. As the New York Times reported:\n\nAhmed Mohamed's homemade alarm clock got him suspended from his suburban Dallas high school and detained and handcuffed by police officers on Monday after school officials accused him of making a fake bomb. By Wednesday, it had brought him an invitation to the White House, support from Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mark Zuckerberg, and a moment of head-spinning attention as questions arose whether he had been targeted because of his name and his religion. As a result, a 14-year-old freshman at MacArthur High School in Irving, Tex., who is partial to tinkering, technology and NASA T-shirts and wants to go to M.I.T., found himself in a social media whirlwind that reflected the nation's charged debates on Islam, immigration and ethnicity.

I don't think-- what drives me crazy, is that no one freaks out about the kids who are suspended for making a gun out of a Pop-Tart, or, you know, drawing something silly on a piece of paper.

Let me give him a word of advice. When he goes to the White House for his clock-building summit with President Obama, he might want to leave that contraption behind because the U.S. Secret Service would have big problems with it.

Zero-tolerance policies at schools, which are the direct result of previous incidents -- the zero tolerance is out of control, such as pretending to shoot a gun with your finger (that gets you sent home) -- is what's responsible here. It's just the latest example, and it's made to order for Obama, because here we have once again backlash against Muslims, you see? That's what this really is. So Obama will be able to make a speech about how dangerous this is, how unfortunate it is, how sorry it is. Innocent little 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has a brilliant science project, a brilliant clock, a new way of doing a clock. (Yeah, one looks just like a bomb in a briefcase.) Obama gets to bring him to the White House, make a star out of him, make Obama's star shine even brighter.

Williamson declared Ahmed's controversial arrest to be \"a phony case of Islamophobia,\" and attacked President Obama and other public figures for expressing support for Ahmed, calling their actions \"cheap moral preening,\" and arguing that the story only received attention because it \"can be used to further a story\" about racism in the United States:\n\nThe story immediately became ubiquitous not because of what actually happened -- boneheaded as that was -- but because it can be used to further a story that the media already want to tell: that the United States is morally corrupt and irredeemably racist; that Muslims are under siege; that \"white privilege\" blinds the majority of Americans to the corruption at the heart of everything red, white, and blue. Muslim kid meets paranoia in Texas is A-1 copy; NRA-wearing kid meets paranoia in West Virginia, not so much. President Barack Obama, never one to miss an opportunity for cheap moral preening, invited Mohamed to the White House.

Why would they? There's no political upside for the Left unless you can scream racism. Then there was the 7 year-old boy suspended for a Pop Tart Gun. Once again: No political upside, no media uproar, no White House invite. Then there was the 5th grade girl who was searched by school officials for possessing a paper gun. No political upside means no media uproar and no White House invite. [Breitbart.com, 9/16/15]\n\nThe Federalist Editor: #IStandWithAhmed Is About \"Pretend Islamaphobia.\" Senior editor of The Federalist, David Harsanyi, argued that public support for Ahmed was \"selective concern trolling\" to create the perception that discrimination against Muslims is a pervasive problem in American life:\n\nSo a story that perfectly illustrated the tendencies of overbearing school administrators is now transformed into a teachable moment about \"Islamophobia.\" And blowing up a nonevent is a way to create the perception that discrimination against Muslims is a pervasive problem in American life. In the real world, though, the preponderance of victims of jumpy teachers are not Muslims. But those cases do not provide Vox or the White House with the fodder they need for some self-satisfying lecturing. [The Federalist, 9/17/15]\n\nTownhall Columnist: Ahmed \"Created An Environment That Required The Teachers To Act.\" Townhall columnist Jim Hanson claimed the school was being unfairly \"slurred as Islamophobic\" and placed the blame on the 14-year-old Ahmed for \"bring[ing] something to school that causes questions to be asked,\" and on \"nanny state, zero tolerance policies.\" Hanson compared Ahmed's clock to pictures of an Iranian-made improvised explosive device (IED) trigger, calling it a \"dead ringer\" for triggers used on homemade bombs the author saw in Iraq:\n\nThe latest outrage being used to promote the false narrative about unfair treatment of Muslims is the teenager, Ahmed Mohamed, in Irving Texas arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school. If you just skimmed the surface and saw the picture of the skinny nerd in the NASA t-shirt in handcuffs it would be easy to see a problem. And there is one, but it's not discrimination against a Muslim kid that wouldn't have happened to a non-Muslim. It's nanny state, zero tolerance policies that take away the ability to apply common sense to complicated situations. In this case, whether or not to put cuffs on a 14 year old when he brings something to school that causes questions to be asked. But as far as the other question, was the clock device he brought to school a legitimate cause for concern, the answer is an unequivocal yes. I have built and taught classes on improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and the clock he brought to school is a dead ringer for the trigger used on many of these homemade bombs. [Townhall.com, 9/17/15]\n\nBreitbart Contributor: Arrest Happened \"Because Of Zero Tolerance Policies, Not Islamophobia.\" Breitbart contributor Merrill Hope argued that the blame for Ahmed's treatment rested with the Irving Schools Code of Conduct, and lamented the \"Islamophobic narrative\" she claimed was perpetuated by President Obama and Hillary Clinton's public support for Ahmed:\n\nOnce the predominantly Islamophobic slanted story broke nationally, outpourings of support for Mohamed exploded on social media. In response, Ahmed Mohamed milked the PR spin. He tweeted: \"Thank you for your support! I really didn't think people would care about a muslim boy. #Thankyouforstandingwithme. #IStandWithAhmed. Not long after, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted out her two cents on social media on the Islamophobic narrative. Not to be outdone, President Barrack Obama also jumped on the bandwagon and invited young Mohamed to the White House. [Breitbart.com, 9/16/15]\n\nInfowars: Notion That Mohamed Was Treated Differently Because Of Race Is \"Completely Bogus.\" At Infowars, Editor-At Large Paul Joseph Watson claimed that Ahmed's story gained attention because of the \"trendy\" fact that the student is Muslim and called the notion that Ahmed's race or religion played a factor in his treatment \"completely bogus\":\n\n14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed built a clock to impress his teacher but ended up in handcuffs after police were called over concerns the object resembled a bomb. The leftist media and social justice warrior 'virtue signallers' immediately leapt on the story to claim that Mohamed was targeted because he was a Muslim (and not because his \"clock\" looked nothing like a clock and more closely resembled a bomb in a briefcase). [...] Never wasting an opportunity to ingratiate himself with the politically correct crowd, Obama reached out to Ahmed and invited him to visit the White House. The notion that white kids wouldn't be treated the same way and that Ahmed was only targeted because of his skin color or religion is completely bogus. Innumerable non-Muslim kids have been disciplined, suspended and even SWAT-teamed for objects far less concerning than Ahmed's clock. [...] To the left, defending American kids who are persecuted for wearing Old Glory just isn't trendy enough, but if a Muslim called Mohamed gets in trouble for bringing something that resembles a bomb to school, liberals are falling over themselves to worship him. [InfoWars.com, 9/17/15]\n\nBreitbart's Ben Shapiro: Ahmed's Experience \"Stinks with Leftist Exploitation.\" Breitbart's Senior Editor-At-Large Ben Shapiro pushed a theory that Ahmed's father, who he called \"an anti-Islamaphobia media gadfly,\" exploited his son's experience to push a message of widespread Islamophobia:\n\nAgain, where was the engineering teacher to vouch for Mohammed's story? Why didn't Mohammed simply explain himself? The police said that initially, it was \"not immediately evident\" that the clock-in-a-case was a class experiment - perfectly plausible, given that Mohammed built the clock-in-a-case voluntarily, without assignment, and in conjunction with no science fair. [Breitbart.com, 9/18/15]\n\nThe Daily Caller: \"Don't Bring A Clock To School Unless It Looks Like a Clock.\" Associate editor of the Daily Caller, Scott Greer, blamed Ahmed for his own arrest, arguing that the teenager \"should have had the good sense\" to keep his clock put away:", "The GOP\u2019s Debate\u2019s Terrifying Alternate Reality: Inside the Political Delusions of a Party On the Edge\n\nOne of the 15 people on stage Wednesday will represent one of the two major parties next year. That's frightening.\n\nWhen I was in elementary and middle school, I was an unapologetic right-leaning Independent. I admired Colin Powell. I stayed up all night transfixed, watching the real life video game spectacle of the first Gulf War on CNN.\n\nAfter listening to Rush Limbaugh during the week, and then watching C-SPAN on Sundays, I would put on my best suit and pretend to be the first black president of the United States; naturally I was a Lincoln/Reagan Republican. I then delivered speeches about American freedom, democracy, justice, and opportunity while I looked in the mirror on my bedroom wall. The preferred scenario was my leading the United States into a war or offering up a version of a Roosevelt fireside chat as economic calamity threatened the country (usually caused by the devious and disciplined Japanese). Only I, the country\u2019s first black President, could unite the people in victory both foreign and domestic.\n\nAs a child of the 1980s, I grew up watching movies such as \u201cRambo,\u201d \u201cRed Dawn,\u201d and \u201cMissing in Action.\u201d I voraciously read \u201cG.I. Joe\u201d comics and military-themed magazines like Soldier of Fortune and Take Off. I played military simulations on my Amiga and Commodore 64 computers. I won World War 3 many times over. I vanquished the Russians, Libyans, and Iranians with ease in my Microsoft flight simulations and SSI turn based strategy games. I stopped the Russians and their allies at the Fulda Gap; I sunk the Warsaw Pact battle fleets in the Kola Peninsula and near Iceland. I wondered, how hard could doing the same thing be in real life?\n\nI knew the secret to beating the Russians and creating a Pax Americana that would spread freedom, democracy, and \u201cAmerican values\u201d around the world: Peace through superior firepower. America is the greatest country on Earth. The real problem is that the rest of the world has not yet been made aware of this self-evident fact.\n\nWednesday evening\u2019s CNN Republican debate featured childish thoughts such as these, thoughts that normally are discarded long ago by reasonable and mature adults, instead now being offered as serious policy analysis from people who want to be President of the United States.\n\nCNN\u2019s Republican debate was a spectacle. In the primaries, candidates struggle to distinguish themselves from one another by running to the extremes in order to win the approval of the most rabid elements of their party\u2019s base. Traditionally, the chosen candidate then veers back to the middle in order to win over the \u201cmedian voter\u201d and independents. These individuals are usually persuadable \u201cswing voters\u201d to one of the United States\u2019 two major parties.\n\nBut, what if the \u201cbase\u201d consists of people who live in an alternate world where facts, empirical reality, and scientific reason and truth operate according to a different set of rules? What happens to a supposedly mainstream political party\u2019s internal dynamics when the most extreme elements are given control over it? And what if these voters have been socialized into an bizarro reality by a media machine that has created a literal and virtual bubble of information for its viewers and listeners, one where the \u201cnews\u201d actually misinforms, thus leaving its public less knowledgeable about current affairs than before?\n\nThis alternate reality is the world in which the Republican Party and its candidates for president in 2016 exist. It is utterly impenetrable to outsiders. \u201cNormal\u201d politics do not exist there. This cult-like world is vexing, confusing, headache inducing, disorientating, and enraging for those in the \u201creality based community\u201d who try to process the 2016 Republican debates. Ultimately, if one is not initiated into the right-wing movement\u2019s rites and rituals, you will not be able to translate its political acts of magic and speaking in tongues that masquerade as serious political discourse.\n\nAs a political cult, today\u2019s Republican Party uses faith, a belief in that which cannot be proven by ordinary means, to create a coherent worldview for its public. In this world there are no verifiable truth-claims that can be confirmed or rejected based on empirical evidence. Here, something is \u201ctrue\u201d because a trusted source, elder, elite, or media personality tells you so. Opinion is transformed into a substitute for facts.\n\nShorter version: Lies are made into truths for those in the cult and disbelievers are cast out as enemies and heretics.\n\nLast night\u2019s Republican debate was a theater and master class in lies. Joseph Goebbels would be proud as the 2016 Republican candidates channeled his Principles of Propaganda and their directives that:\n\nPropaganda to the home front must create an optimum anxiety level.\n\nPropaganda must facilitate the displacement of aggression by specifying the targets for hatred.\n\nThe reality is this: Social security will not be bankrupt in 7 to 8 years. George Bush did not keep America \u201csafe\u201d as he presided over the worst terrorist attacks in the country\u2019s history. The Iraqi government demanded that the United States leave after years of a disastrous war\u2014Obama did not choose to \u201cabandon\u201d the country of Iraq. Global warming is a fact. And \u201cBenghazi\u201d has been investigated repeatedly. There is only malfeasance and \u201ctreason\u201d in the minds of the right-wing faithful and their media. Christians are not \u201cunder assault\u201d in America.\n\nDeceptively editing videos of Planned Parenthood are the real crime; the crime is not that Planned Parenthood offers reproductive health services to women and provides body tissue to help in research to cure cancer and other diseases.\n\nGun control laws actually decrease gun violence and gun-related murder rates. The facile thinking that laws are only obeyed by the \u201clawful\u201d, and therefore apparently have no use, is the fantasy those who want to live in a Hobbesian state of nature.\n\nChildish thinking, lies, and increasing rates of authoritarian belief and social dominance behavior among conservatives, are both reflected in and encouraged by the modern right-wing imagination.\n\nThe Republican 2016 candidates \u2014 with perhaps the exception of Rand Paul, at least on this one issue \u2014 seem either unable or unwilling to grasp how the chaos and confusion in the Middle East, which they bemoan and panic over as a sign of a \u201cweak\u201d America (and of course caused only by President Obama), are directly (and indirectly) the result of the policies of the Bush administration.\n\nA country and people without a past, unable to comprehend cause and effect, are living in an empire of illusion where the neoliberal nightmare, and the culture of cruelty, force them into an immediate present in which there is no historical context for understanding the forces that shape society and create a state of immiseration among the masses. The masses cannot effectively respond because they are so utterly and completely disoriented.\n\nWednesday night\u2019s Republican debate did however feature one bright, shining, moment, when Donald Trump, professional wrestling heel and reality TV star, let slip a basic truth: In response to a question about foreign policy, Trump admitted what an insightful and observant global public has always known about today\u2019s Republican Party, when he explained that he is \u201ca very militaristic person.\u201d Of course, he was not condemned, booed, or heckled by his fellow candidates, nor those in the audience at the Reagan library.\n\nIn their own way, ugly truths can be very refreshing.\n\nMike Huckabee ended Wednesday night\u2019s debate by channeling Ronald Reagan, and the Republican Party\u2019s racist Southern Strategy \u201claw and order\u201d ethos, by threatening the Black Lives Matter movement. This was the expected and boilerplate Republican politics of white racial resentment in the Age of Obama.\n\nMeanwhile, it was Carly Fiorina who embodied the evening\u2019s greatest praxis of childish politics, authoritarianism, lies, myth making, and cultish delusions. As though she were on a high school debate team, Fiorina delivered a hackneyed and tired speech to the Republican faithful about the Statue of Liberty and blind Lady Justice. In Fiorina\u2019s ahistorical world, American justice does not consistently discriminate against the poor and black people. In her utopian conception of American exceptionalism, the United States did not have immigration quotas and racist laws which for most of its history guaranteed that it would remain a majority white country, where people of color were not welcome.\n\nWednesday night\u2019s CNN debate showed the American people an alternate reality where Chuck Norris movies are the Bible for statecraft and childish speeches about the Statue of Liberty are considered respectable and serious political thought.\n\nThe 2016 Republican primary season is a human zoo. The frightening fact is that one of the survivors of this battle royal will be one of the two candidates for President of the United States next year.\n\nAdult children who dress up and give speeches as they role-play being President of the United States are competing in a real life Republican cosplay competition to be one of the most powerful people on Earth. This is an epic Greek tragedy for the 21st century age of 24/7 cable news and reality television.", "All of a sudden, politicians slithering this way from Florida are slightly more concerning than The University of Florida football team.

It is an outrage.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Sanders said, \u201cTrump must apologize to the president and American people for continuing the lie that the president is not an American and not a Christian.\u201d\n\nWatch.", "GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina likes to portray herself as a hard-liner on Iran. However, during Fiornia\u2019s six-year tenure at Hewlett-Packard between 1999 and 2005, the company sold more than $100 million worth of computers and other high-tech equipment to Iranian customers, despite US export sanctions at the time. It\u2019s a small detail she has neglected to mention while on the campaign trail.\n\nHow did HP do it? The usual corporate schemes: the products were channeled through one of HP\u2019s European subsidiaries, and sold through an IT distributor in Dubai, known as Reddington Gulf. The sales continued long after HP sacked Fiorina. By 2007, more than 40% of printers sold in Iran bore the HP trademark.\n\nHP had started skirting Iran sanctions in 1997, two years before Fiorina came on board. By that time, sanctions imposed by the Clinton Administration had been in place for two years. However, there was a loophole in the law that allowed HP to do business in Iran \u201clegally,\u201d albeit indirectly. Under the rules in place at the time, foreign subsidiaries of American companies were considered outside of US jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the issue came to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2009 because of concerns that the equipment might be used for military or terrorism-related purposes. HP\u2019s legal department claimed that, because the subsidiaries were not \u201cUnited States [corporate] person(s),\u201d they were not subject to US sales restrictions.\n\nFiorina continued the HP scheme to get computers to Iran after she took over as CEO. Her compliance in violating US sanctions against Iran was highlighted in the Boston Globe in 2008 when Fiorina was attempting to unseat California Senator Barbara Boxer. The issue torpedoed her campaign then \u2013 and it could very well sink Fiorina again. Senator Boxer thought so when she told MSNBC: \u201cSo she\u2019s got so many problems. I say if the Republicans choose her, we\u2019ll walk into the presidency.\u201d\n\nDuring the first GOP debate, Fiorina declared that on her first day in office she would call Iranian leader Ali Khameni with the following message: \u201cUntil you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around.\u201d As CEO of Hewlett-Packard, however, Fiorina had no problem with Iran moving money into her own company\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt reminds us of another American businessman-turned Republican politician who got wealthy doing business with a government hostile toward the US. His name was Prescott Bush \u2013 and the country in which he was doing business was Nazi Germany.\n\nSome things never change\u2026", "The Obama administration's policy toward Syria and its more than four-year civil war is rapidly becoming a black mark on the president's legacy.\n\nAnd a scathing new report by Peter Baker of The New York Times details the mind-boggling decision by the White House to refuse to accept any responsibility.\n\nThe blame for the failed US effort to train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS \"should be pointed not at Mr. Obama but at those who pressed him to attempt training Syrian rebels in the first place,\" administration officials told Baker.\n\nThere are only \"four or five\" US-trained rebels left fighting in Syria after a group of 60 were ambushed in August by the Al Qaeda branch in Syria, the Nusra Front.\n\n'The devil made me do it'\n\nObama's argument, according to Baker, is that \"he reluctantly went along with those who said it was the way to combat the Islamic State, but that he never wanted to do it and has now has been vindicated in his original judgment.\"\n\nBut some people who worked in Obama's administration disagree \u2014 and they're calling him out.\n\n\"It looks like the White House would like to blame its critics for its own operational illiteracy,\" Frederic Hof, a former special adviser for transition in Syria under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, told Business Insider over email.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen any other administration employ 'the devil made me do it' argument to excuse and explain its own shortcomings.\n\n\"In this case a micromanaging White House saddled [the Defense Department] with something dead on arrival due to a lopsided anti-ISIL mission (one that tried to ignore Assad) and crippling vetting requirements,\" Hof added, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State, or ISIS.\n\nRyan Crocker, a retired career diplomat who was an ambassador to Afghanistan under Obama, echoed Hof's sentiments.\n\n\u201cHow un-presidential that sounds \u2014 \u2018We didn\u2019t want to do it. We thought it was unsound, but you made us do it,\u2019\u201d Crocker told The Times. \u201cIt\u2019s just indicative of their whole approach to Syria, which is not to have a policy. This is the worst thing they could say.\u201d\n\nThe administration's new argument also flies in the face of a furious push to secure funding for the proposal last year. Obama pressed Congress to pass $500 million amid widespread suspicion from his own Democratic allies. The legislation ultimately ended up prompting more than 90 Democrats in the House and Senate to vote against the president's priority.\n\nWhen it passed through Congress, he hailed it as a the best option to help \"destroy ISIL without American troops fighting another ground war in the Middle East.\"\n\n'Doctors, farmers, pharmacists'\n\nObama has always been skeptical about supporting nationalist Syrian rebels attempting to topple Assad.\n\nObama famously told The New York Times that the notion arming the rebels would have made a difference has \u201calways been a fantasy\" because the opposition of \"former doctors, farmers, pharmacists, and so forth\" was fighting \"a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, [and] a battle-hardened Hezbollah.\"\n\nIn 2014, Hof wrote that the recommendation to arm the moderate opposition was offered in some form by Clinton \u2014 who is now running to succeed Obama in the White House \u2014 as well as then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, then-CIA Director David Petraeus, and outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Martin Dempsey.\n\n\"From the beginning there has been no shortage of criticism \u2014 both internal and external \u2014 and alternatives, culminating in our Atlantic Council April 2015 'Syrian National Stabilization Force' study,\" Hof told Business Insider.\n\n\"There is no Obama administration strategy for Syria. There never has been one. It's running out of time to come up with one.\"\n\nNow, four-plus years into the Syrian civil war, the worsening situation for the Obama administration is becoming clear: Russia is flying in arms and troops to help bolster the regime of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nMore than half the Syrian population has been displaced, spawning a growing and tragic refugee crisis spanning across Europe. And more than 250,000 people are dead, while Assad continues to barrel bomb his country's own citizens.\n\nObama has long publicly hoped to avoid getting mired in the Syrian crisis. Observers argue that's a result both of a war-weary public and a desire to clinch a nuclear deal with Iran, which is Assad's primary backer, along with Russia.\n\n\"They don\u2019t have an overall Syria strategy,\" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group. \"It\u2019s been one of the two biggest strategic failures of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy. (The other being Russia.)\n\n\"Obama's approach with Syria has consistently been risk-averse. Try not to get sucked into a crisis where there are no easy answers ... but then as consistently respond when the pressure to 'do something' becomes too great.\"\n\nCritics argue that Obama's strategic foreign-policy missteps \u2014 dealing with the Syrian conflict and with Russia and its unpredictable president, Vladimir Putin \u2014 are merging as Russia and Iran double down on their support of Assad's regime.\n\nObama may not see the end of the Syrian crisis before he leaves office after next year; Defense Secretary Ash Carter certainly doesn't think so. And so now, incidentally, he's been forced into perhaps the only realistic option he's sown with his strategy.\n\n\"The United States doesn\u2019t have the economic or military will to change the balance of forces on the ground themselves,\" Bremmer said. \"And we don\u2019t have the potential allies in Syria to act as an effective proxy. Accordingly, we\u2019ve just announced we\u2019re going to start talking to the Russians about Syria.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m sure that was an incredibly unpleasant decision for the Obama administration to make \u2014 especially after all that talk of isolating Russia for their bad behavior. But in terms of accepting the reality of the situation, better late than never.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: A mysterious lost Nazi train \u2014 supposedly filled with gold \u2014 may have been found", "The British documentary maker Sean McAllister made headlines in 2011 when he was seized by the Syrian secret police. His capture had a devastating impact on the couple whose lives he was filming at the time, but they say it was worth it for the film they made together.\n\nSpoiler warning: Details of the film A Syrian Love Story are revealed\n\nFrom his prison cell, Sean McAllister could hear the screams of Syria's revolutionaries. It was October 2011 and the country was slipping deeper into war. McAllister, a film-maker, had been jumped on by secret police in Damascus, blindfolded, and brought to the prison, where he became a witness to the regime's brutal treatment of protesters and activists.\n\n\"There's a sort of softening-up torture, with these 20-year-old kids with inner tubes and cables and they just whip and whip and whip, and you just hear people screaming in different rooms,\" he recalls. \"They do that for a couple of hours before they bundle them into windowless dungeons where there's hardly enough room to sit down.\"\n\nWhen he was released, McAllister's testimony made headlines, but at the time his thoughts were focused on the family he had been filming for a documentary, which is now on release in the UK. A Syrian Love Story follows two married activists, Amer Daoud and Raghda Hasan, and their children over a five-year period.\n\nWhen McAllister was detained in 2011, the authorities took his equipment, which contained footage of the couple speaking out against the regime and organising protests. But when the police demanded to know where they were, McAllister misdirected them, giving Daoud and Hasan time to flee to Lebanon.\n\n\"At that point I felt terribly guilty, but then after that for the next year it was terrible, because they were then suffering, stuck in Beirut,\" says McAllister.\n\nHaving become very much part of the story, McAllister continued to film the family - and they did nothing to stop him.\n\n\"I actually thought Sean was a window of hope,\" says Daoud. \"Because we are political activists. As political activists you have a higher goal in life, you have a message that you want to convey and communicate as well.\"\n\nImage caption Sean McAllister and Amer Daoud\n\nMcAllister had arrived in Syria in 2008, seeking a break from his work in war zones and curious about life in what he calls a \"functioning dictatorship\". For eight months, he searched for a story that would allow him to get beyond the picture-postcard image of Syria that officials presented to tourists. Then, one night in a park in Damascus, he met Daoud, who told him: \"If you really want to make a film about Syria, come and film me.\"\n\nMcAllister had found his story about Syria - and it was a love story.\n\nA member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, Daoud had spent three years in prison, where he had formed a relationship with the woman in the adjacent cell. Raghda Hasan's background was very different - she came from the same Alawite sect as the president - but she was also a dissident, a communist revolutionary. The two made a small hole in the wall separating them and, after months of communicating through it, they fell in love. When they were released from prison, they got married and had two children together.\n\n\"All we wanted was to be together all the time - and nothing would separate us, even death,\" recalls Daoud.\n\nBut at the time McAllister met him and his children, Hasan was in prison once again for writing a novel based on the couple's relationship, among other things.\n\nHasan was released again in 2011 as part of an amnesty, one of the Syrian government's responses to the Arab Spring.\n\nBut not long afterwards, the family had to make their escape to Lebanon and it was there that the marriage began to break down. Unable to live at a distance from the revolution she had longed for and worked towards, Hasan returned to Syria. And without her, her husband and children were unable to seek asylum in Europe.\n\nThe family eventually reunited and sought refuge in France, but exile - the life of the refugee - did not bring happiness.\n\nIn long, claustrophobic scenes shot in the couple's apartment - the Sheffield documentary festival, which awarded the film its top prize earlier this year, drew parallels with the work of Ingmar Bergman - the viewer is witness to the couple's rancour and mutual recrimination. There is an affair. There is a suicide attempt.\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to Sean McAllister and Amer Daoud speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nA Syrian Love Story is in UK cinemas now and will be on BBC television in the UK on 28 September\n\n\"It was bizarre,\" says McAllister, \"because they were in Albi, this idyllic, beautiful place in the south of France, which is I guess the dream - and I was thinking back to the beginning of this journey, when they'd been dreaming of freedom and in this bizarre kind of way, this was freedom.\n\n\"But in getting there they'd lost so much and each other - and they couldn't make sense of themselves or where they were.\"\n\nThey began to look to McAllister to make sense of it all for them. They both rang him regularly, asking him to come to France to act as a prosecuting counsel or judge in their quarrels. Instead, he was a witness, albeit one with powers to cross-examine.\n\n\"When you were a prisoner, he loved you,\" McAllister reminds Hasan at one point. \"All Syrians love prisoners,\" she replies.\n\n\"No,\" McAllister says, \"he loved his wife.\"\n\nAgain and again, we see the family reviewing McAllister's footage from 2010 and 2011 - a record of their earlier family life that doubles as a reminder of the country they had left behind and of friends and relatives who had been killed.\n\nHasan now lives in Turkey, where she has a role in Syria's opposition government. Daoud still lives in France, along with the children. He watched the final cut of McAllister's film on a laptop in a cafe.\n\n\"When I watched the film, I thought: 'There's me, there's my wife and my children.' And I couldn't hold back my tears,\" says Daoud. \"I cried for hours and hours on my own, just feeling sorry for myself and my life, feeling sorry for my children, feeling sorry for Raghda. What is now and what could have been - all these thoughts were just going through my mind for days after watching the film.\"\n\nDaoud believes that his marriage would not have broken down if Syria had been at peace. \"I'm sure,\" he says, \"because we have a great love story.\"\n\nWhen McAllister began filming in 2010, he could not foresee the Arab Spring or the civil war. For much of the last five years he worked on the film as a \"labour of love\" without a commission from a network. But then came another unexpected development - the sudden interest from the media in the plight of Syrian refugees.\n\nSean McAllister and Amer Daoud spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service.

Sitting at her kitchen table one recent afternoon in front of a stack of Securus bills, Jones explained that her 29-year-old son, Nate Jones, had been arrested on an aggravated robbery charge in January 2014. Her son\u2019s life may have taken a negative turn, but Jones tries to keep in touch with him as often as possible. They speak roughly once a week in a 15-minute phone call, and speak for another 25 minutes on a video chat. Jones says she\u2019d travel to Texas to visit her son in person, but Hays County Jail, where he is locked up, banned visitations in November 2013. That happened shortly after the county jail entered into a contract with Securus. The cost to keep in touch, Jones says, \u201cmakes me ill.\u201d Since then, all family communication with inmates at Hays County goes through Securus, which charges Jones about $10 for a phone call and about $8 for a video visit. In the year and a half that her son has been locked up, Jones says she has racked up over $1,000 in bills with Securus to keep in contact with her son. The cost to keep in touch, Jones says, \u201cmakes me ill.\u201d Over the last decade, the prison phone business has become a scandalous industry, characterized by lawsuits, exorbitant fees, high phone rates and monopolistic relationships between public jails and private companies that openly offer kickbacks to local sheriffs. In May 2015, Foster Campbell, the Louisiana Public Service commissioner, described the prison phone business in his state as \u201cworse than any payday loan scheme.\u201d \u201cRegardless of what they\u2019re using the money for, this is about shifting the cost of the police state onto the backs of the poor people being policed,\u201d says Paul Wright, executive director of Human Rights Defense Center and a longtime advocate for more affordable prison phone rates. In June, Jones provided International Business Times with her Securus-related bills. Even a cursory examination of the documents reveals several questionable fees, including a $3.99 \u201cwireless administration fee,\u201d and a $7.95 payment processing fee every time she loads money into Nate\u2019s commissary account. At Hays County jail, where her son is incarcerated, a 25-minute video call costs $7.99, which is actually a pretty good price compared to the the $20 (for a 20-minute call) she paid Securus when he was locked up in nearby Bastrop County Jail. A 15-minute phone call, also operated by Securus, costs $9.29, plus tax. Ironically, because of recent Federal Communications Commission regulations, out-of-state calls should be a little bit cheaper, but because Jones has a Texas area code on her cell phone, the calls are more expensive. On a recent Wednesday afternoon, Jones and her son spoke to each other on a video chat. As she anxiously waited for his face to appear on the screen, she trained her eyes on the little digital box where he was set to appear. Finally, when his face showed up in the display, her eyes lit up. \u201cHi Nate!\u201d she exclaimed. She asked about the weather down in Texas and his haircut. They also discussed the latest novel they\u2019ve begun reading simultaneously: \u201cThe Goldfinch.\u201d It\u2019s about a young boy who survives an attack that kills his mother. Because Nate has not yet been convicted of a crime, Jones\u2019 lawyers have urged her not to speak about her son\u2019s case. But Jones says Nate already is taking steps to turn his life around behind bars. She says he recently was accepted into a college correspondence course in Colorado, where he plans to study business and entrepreneurship. In the meantime, he passes the time by reading novels and playing Sudoku. Nate is just one of an estimated 2.2 million inmates currently behind bars in America. If you\u2019ve ever tried to call an inmate, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve heard of Securus, or its main competitor, Global Tel*Link (GTL). GTL was recently featured by Bloomberg, which reported that NPR spent $2,500 on phone bills to report for its \u201cSerial\u201d podcast. Lupe Fiasco, a popular rapper from Chicago\u2019s South Side, even sings about \u201cspendin\u2019 50 thousand on Securus\u201d on a recent track. The two companies reportedly make up about 80 percent of the prison phone business, which drives about $1.2 billion per year in revenues. In the last few years, Securus, especially, has emerged into one of the largest, if not most secretive, prison technology companies in the business. The company employs 1,000 associates in 46 states, contracts with 2,600 jails and prisons across North America, and provides service to more than 1 million inmates and their families. About 400,000 phone calls are placed each day, according to company statements. Securus positions itself a \u201chigh-tech\u201d operator that pours its resources into research and development. \u201cWe lead the industry with all of our technology solutions,\u201d Rick Smith, CEO of Securus Technologies, said in a recent press release. Jones chafes at statements like that. She says the video calls are grainy and prone to drop, and she notes that Securus\u2019 system does not even support Apple Macs, which Securus acknowledges on their website. Regardless, because consumers have little choice in the provider they use, business has been good for Securus: Abry Partners, a Boston-based private equity group, acquired a major stake in Securus in 2013 for $640 million. Securus executives have long-refuted the notion that they are a particularly profitable company. In 2013, Rick Smith said that prison advocates \u201cembellish\u201d the profitability of the prison phone business. At a July 2014 hearing with the FCC, Smith argued that, compared to other phone operators--from Verizon to AT&T--Securus\u2019 profits were actually quite small. \u201cWe don\u2019t earn excessive profits,\u201d Rick Smith said at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t earn excessive profits. We don\u2019t earn excessive profits. I said that three times for the egregious and abusive and predatory kinds of comments that come at us most of the time.\u201d However, leaked company documents from a Securus investor presentation, which were obtained and published by the Huffington Post, and later reported by the New York Post and the Prison Policy Initiative, tell a different story. The slides show that Securus earned $114.6 million in profits in 2014, on revenues of about $404 million -- margins comparable to companies like Apple and Google. In an e-mail, Securus\u2019 Smith said \u201cthe HuffPost\u201d received three PowerPoint slides \u201cillegally\u201d from \u201cour recent bank presentation\u201d but did not comment on their authenticity. He also declined a request for an interview. On June 17, Securus noted in a letter to the FCC that \u201cthe figures set forth in the article are simply incorrect or taken in the incorrect context.\u201d A week later, on June 25, the Human Rights Defense Center wrote in a letter to the FCC that \u201cSecurus did not explain why, if the data was inaccurate, it was included in the company\u2019s investor presentation.\u201d Either way, those profit numbers are of particular interest to the FCC. By the end of this summer, the FCC will expand its 2013 regulations on the prison phone business. The new regulations have the potential to present a historic shift in the prison phone business. Should the FCC decide to limit commissions paid to sheriffs and cap excessive fees companies are allowed to charge consumers, the new rules could fundamentally change the way the industry operates. The reform is welcomed by advocates and their families -- but, perhaps not too surprisingly, Securus is on the defensive. After all, billions of dollars are at stake. The prison phone business has been characterized by relationships between public jails and private companies that openly offer kickbacks to local sheriffs. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who was appointed to office by President Barack Obama in 2009, is looking very closely at how companies like Securus operate and make money. \u201cPeople should be treated with as much dignity and respect as possible, even if they are incarcerated,\u201d Clyburn said in an exclusive interview with IBTimes. \u201cThese families deserve the same level of consideration than any other consumer of a telecommunications product. They deserve that. I am committed to answer that call.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe prison phone business is a wildly complex, fiercely secretive and enormously lucrative industry. Already, interested parties have held quiet skirmishes behind the scenes to protect their interests. Perhaps the most controversial element of the FCC plan to rein in the costs of prisoner calls is to limit the amount of commissions that get paid back to county sheriffs. Critics like Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, say it\u2019s the commissions, ultimately, that have driven costs so high. When companies like Securus send proposals to jails and prisons around the country, they offer a percentage of the call rate back to the sheriff\u2019s office. Jail administrators say that allowing inmates to speak on the phones cost them money, because they need to pay guards to monitor the calls. It\u2019s typical for commissions to range anywhere from 40 percent and 80 percent. They can be higher. In Arizona, for instance, commissions have reached as much as 93.9 percent of the call revenue, according to Cronkite News. The size of these commissions -- and the price at which companies like Securus place their rates -- are often big factors in winning the bid with the jail or prison. \u201cIn a normal market, people that use a product get to pick the product based on the features that benefit them,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cHere, the decisions are made by a third party -- in this case, the facility who have a financial incentive in making sure that the rates are as high as possible.\u201d Critics say commissions paid to sheriffs help drive up prison phone fees. At Hays County Jail, where Joanne Jones\u2019 son is incarcerated, Securus collects $9.29 for each call placed by him. However, reports show that Securus then pays up to 58 percent, or $5.39, back to the Hays County sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nIn fact, this relationship has become something of a marketing selling point for companies like Securus. Securus boasts that over the last 10 years, it has generated some $1.3 billion in commissions. Wagner says that allowing jails and prisons to recover their costs makes sense; but this dynamic has been exploited for financial gain for local police departments around the country. Perhaps not surprisingly, sheriffs who run the jails -- and who collect the commissions -- are not pleased with the decision to limit their revenues. In response to the suggestion that the FCC might eliminate commissions, more than 200 sheriffs recently filed letters of opposition with the FCC, claiming they\u2019ll rip the phones from the wall if the government takes away their commissions. In other words, if the government takes away their commissions, the sheriffs will take away the phones from inmates and their families. After all, the sheriffs argue that they incur a variety of costs by providing the phone service, and the commissions help alleviate the financial burden. When reached by telephone earlier this year, Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs Association, told IBTimes that, should the FCC do away with commissions, \u201cit\u2019s very possible that sheriffs could elect to eliminate the calls ... they don\u2019t have to provide a call service.\u201d Thompson did not return followup e-mails. In theory, sheriffs are supposed to use this money to offset the cost of providing the phone services and provide inmate welfare services. However, some critics allege there\u2019s very little cost actually incurred by offering the service, especially because companies like Securus will pay for the installation themselves. In 2011, for instance, Securus paid the Hays County Jail $40,000 for the privilege of installing the phones, according to news reports at the time. \u201cEvery single filing I\u2019ve ever seen from the sheriffs is about the money,\u201d says Wright. \u201cThat\u2019s all they\u2019re talking about.\n\nPaul Wright, head of the Human Rights Defense Center, also says that there\u2019s little oversight over the money that\u2019s generated from these commissions, and the funds are often misspent. For instance, in the Orange County Jail in California in 2010, the inmate welfare services fund grew to $5,016,429. Of that sum, 74 percent was used to pay staff salaries, according to documents filed with the FCC. About 0.8% was used for inmate educational programs and 0.06% was used for inmate re-entry programs. \u201cEvery single filing I\u2019ve ever seen from the sheriffs is about the money,\u201d says Wright. \u201cThat\u2019s all they\u2019re talking about. They aren\u2019t giving a rat\u2019s ass about safety, about recidivism, encouraging family contact, keeping people out of jail in the first place -- it\u2019s literally all about \u2018Hey, we got budgets, and we need money.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, many politicians are standing firm with the law enforcement community. A review of documents filed with the FCC reveals that six members of Congress have lobbied in support of the sheriffs. They urge the FCC to consider how reducing phone rates and commissions could affect the jails\u2019 ability to monitor calls -- as well as how regulations could affect county budgets. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, wrote in a letter to the FCC dated Sept. 4, 2014, that, although his office supports making rates fair for families, \u201cthe enforcement community is understandably alarmed about how potential Inmate Calling System rate changes might affect revenues.\u201d Warner notes that his Virginia district receives $13.5 million from prison telephones. Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., similarly wrote on Dec. 11, 2014, that \u201cit is not unreasonable to allow the use of [inmate calling service] monies to fund other general services needed at prisons.\u201d Other legislators disagree with the approach. \u201cIt is an absolute abuse of a situation,\u201d said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat from New Jersey, said in an interview with IBTimes. \u201cThere should be no profit associated with keeping a family connected, even with an individual who has made a mistake and is paying for it by being incarcerated.\u201d\n\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look for this country to be concerned about profitability on the backs of people who are poor and people who are incarcerated.\"\n\nShe added, \u201cThis is not a good look for the United States of America. It\u2019s not a good look for this country to be concerned about profitability on the backs of people who are poor and people who are incarcerated.\u201d\n\nOne may wonder how companies like Securus can turn such staggering profits if they are giving so much of the calling money back to sheriffs.\n\nThe answer, according to experts, may be relatively straightforward: Unregulated fees and \u201csingle-call\u201d programs, which charge as high as $14.95 for a single 15-minute phone call. \u201cThe company is hiding the revenue it collects from fees,\u201d says Peter Wagner of the Prison Policy Initiative. \u201cThe business model has evolved so that the business model is what I call \u201cfee harvesting,\u201d says Peter Wagner, director of the Prison Policy Initiative. \u201cRather than actually selling phone service and making money as a phone company, the phone calls are just a gimmick in order to charge the fees, because that\u2019s where the real money is.\u201d Wagner has spent considerable time and resources studying Securus\u2019 business model. Because commissions paid to sheriffs are only based on the call rates -- and not the fees -- Wagner says companies like Securus have increased the number of fees to recoup the lost revenue from the commissions. \u201cThe companies playing the fee game look generous because they are promising to share up to 99% of the rate revenue with facilities,\u201d Wagner wrote in a June report. \u201cBut that \u201cgenerosity\u201d is only possible because the company is hiding the revenue it collects from fees.\u201d\n\nIn September 2014, Securus, along with Global Tel*Link and Telmate, the two other major prison phone providers, presented a nine-page proposal to the FCC on what they believed a fair regulation would look like. In it, they address commissions, fees and the costs of providing phone services. The proposal asks the FCC to institute \u201cflat rate caps\u201d of 20 cents per minute. Critics, like Paul Wright and the Human Rights Defense Center, don\u2019t believe 20 cents is fair. They advocate a call rate of 6 cents per minute. Wright notes that if the FCC decides to eliminate the commission structure -- and therefore get to keep the entirety of the call revenue -- the proposal would actually, ironically, be a win-win for companies like Securus. Detention Officer Rene Ansley looks on as visitors use video phones to talk with inmates at Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s Maricopa County \"tent city\" jail in Phoenix May 3, 2010. Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images In a recent filing with the FCC, Wright pointed out that the actual costs companies like Securus bear to provide the phone services are remarkably low. West Virginia, for instance, recently imposed the lowest rates and commissions in the country: All calls will now cost 3.5 cents per minute, while the correctional facility will take 0.1% commission. \u201cThis is not only another example of the low costs that [inmate calling service] providers can charge and still make a profit,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut also more evidence of the link between lower rates and an effective elimination of the commission.\u201d In order to decide on an appropriate rate, the FCC asked all of the prison phone companies to supply it with their costs. Securus complied with the FCC under the condition that its cost documents would not be available to the public under a protective seal. In late April, IBTimes filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FCC to release Securus documents pertaining to the true costs of operating in prisons and jails. The request was ultimately denied by the FCC after a series of stern objections from Securus\u2019 legal counsel, Stephanie Joyce, who wrote that should any of Securus\u2019 cost documents leak, \u201cthe likelihood of irreparable, devastating harm is extremely high.\u201d\n\nThough some may consider it an unsavory business, the prison technology industry appears to be an attractive bet for investors. In 2013, Abry Partners of Boston bought a major stake in Securus. One of the private equity group\u2019s core values is to invest in high-growth businesses that have \u201cpredictable, recurring revenues -- such as subscription-like businesses with high customer retention rates.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, for now at least, how Abry views Securus in light of the new round of FCC regulations. Abry did not return a request for an interview. Over the past few years, Securus has expanded into a variety of new services, including video visitations and electronic monitoring. In other words, they\u2019ve seemed to be able to leverage their profits to expand their business. Backed by Abry, Securus was able to purchase JPay, a prison payment-processing company that also sells tablets to inmates, for a reported $205 million. According to a recent company press release, Securus has purchased 13 companies in the last 39 months. \u201cSecurus\u2019 solutions have been very successful and are reaching new milestones of success in keeping our world safe and connecting what matters,\u201d the company noted. Recently, the company opened a 10,000-square-foot \u201ctechnology center\u201d to show off their new products.", "It's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

Scott Walker boasted that he \u201ctook on union bosses from Washington\u201d in his 2011 effort to crush state public-employee union rights.\n\nBut according to a stunning, detailed new statement by a former top Republican legislative aide, it turns out that Walker isolated himself and hid in tightly controlled, heavily-guarded environments during the conflict covering six intense weeks in early 2011\u2014which directly contradicts his tall tale of courageously facing his adversaries.\n\n\u201cOur unintimidated governor continued to only participate in private events with the media excluded or tightly controlled,\u201d wrote Michael Boerger, former top aide to retired Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis, in a September 10 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion piece.\n\nUnintimidated is the title of Walker\u2019s fact-challenged biography that recounts fiercely battling tens of thousands of pro-labor advocates as he pushed Act 10 into law. The legislation stripped most Wisconsin employees of any practical rights to union representation.\n\nWalker\u2019s reliance on his oft-told tale of political courage did not help deliver a breakout performance to counter his slipping poll numbers at Wednesday\u2019s debate. But Boerger\u2019s astonishing account of a man who hid from his critics and the public\u2014but later boasted of facing down enemies\u2014could mark a turning point for his 2016 ambitions.\n\nAs Boerger noted in his recent Milwaukee Journal Sentinel op-ed, while Walker sat quivering in fear, Madison police reported virtually no violence despite crowds of up to 150,000 protesters who stayed peaceful throughout the protracted battle over the legislation.\n\nWalker is a promoting a national anti-labor agenda as a cornerstone of his presidential campaign. In March, he signed a \u201cright-to-work\u201d bill for Wisconsin despite repeated assurances to the public and in private to conservative labor leaders that such a bill would never reach his desk. More recently, he has called for federal right-to-work laws, which discourage union membership and suppress wages, banning federal employee unions and closing the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nEven those who know Walker best are not impressed with his latest anti-union plans. Milwaukee\u2019s Journal Sentinel, a conservative paper which endorsed Walker three times for governor, dismissed his call for \u201cAct 10 nationwide\u201d and basically called him a serial liar.\n\n\u201cIt is more politicking from a governor who as recently as last year when running for re-election called right-to-work a distraction, then proceeded to sign the legislation anyway when it passed the Legislature,\u201d it editorialized. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growing distrust of Walker are Boerger\u2019s revelations that reveal Walker was hardly \u201cunintimidated\u201d in confronting unions. Last winter, candidate Walker ridiculously said that his battle with unionists showed that he could stand up to ISIS terrorists.\n\nWalker has also repeatedly said that he showed leadership by pushing Republican legislative leaders to fully support Act 10, which Boerger resented. His op-ed opened, \u201cAs a front-row witness to the sad history of the passage of Act 10, I have to refute the notion currently being advanced by Gov. Scott Walker that he faced stiff opposition to his proposal from GOP legislative leaders.\u201d\n\nBoerger\u2019s comments reflect the bitterness of Republicans who feel that they took the brunt of criticism from voters and were forced to engage in extraordinary anti-democratic tactics to prevent a high-profile loss for the new governor under an international spotlight\u2014as the Madison rebellion coincided with a popular uprising in Egypt and captured international headlines and TV coverage. Despite the GOP legislators\u2019 willingness to bend the rules to pass Act 10 for Walker, they saw themselves as unappreciated by the governor.\n\n\u201cEvery day that spring, legislators had to run a gantlet of protesters and meet in public in the Capitol for committee meetings and legislative sessions,\u201d stated Boerger. \u201cMeanwhile, our unintimidated governor was making speeches in minutely controlled, private venues that often even excluded attendance by the media.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Walker was so petrified of any direct challenge that he initially planned to deliver his high-profile budget address away from the State Capitol in a more tightly-guarded site, Boerger said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, the governor even planned to give his budget address outside the Capitol in such a private, security-dominated venue. Unintimidated? It was GOP leaders who convinced the governor to appear in public, in the statehouse as every other governor has done.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first account that has revealed Walker\u2019s self-described profile in courage as a big lie. While Republican legislators often faced protesters in heated dialogue as they circulated around the Capitol, Walker remained cloistered in his heavily-guarded office and \u201cslunk to and from the state Capitol via underground tunnels\u201d with armed escorts, Guardian journalist Jeb Lund reported.\n\nAs Walker\u2019s presidential ambitions keep floundering, it is beginning to appear that he is fated to return his bunker at the Capitol\u2014where he hid when he first launched his attack on labor and nurtured his presidential ambitions. But this time, he would be hiding from everyone who he used to fan his presidential ambitions.", "\u200bBoy howdy, that's a serious burial job that the Washington Post did on the campaign of Scott Walker, the goggle-eyed homunculus hired by Koch Industries to manage their Midwest subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin. His numbers are plunging. His donors are fleeing. His campaign staff is turning swiftly into a Machiavellian papacy. And everybody, it seems, is telling tales out of school.\n\nSome of those on Thursday's donor call had expected different news. Many backers have directed their ire at campaign manager Rick Wiley, who some Walker supporters believe expanded the staff too quickly and has failed to calibrate spending during the summer fundraising season. A recent count put the number of full-time Walker campaign staff at around 90, and there have been no cutbacks in salaries as there were earlier this summer in former Florida governor Jeb Bush's operation. \"There is a substantial amount of chatter that he needs to go,\" said one major Walker fundraiser, requesting anonymity to discuss private conversations. \"People are worried.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n(Holy hell, the knives really are out.)\n\nWiley's lucky. The fat cats just want him fired. Usually, when somebody leaves a Scott Walker political operation, it's via perp walk. Even so, the list of people used and discarded by Scott Walker on the trail of slime he's followed into high office is long and distinguished. Of course, Scottie knows who's to blame for his current problems. It's The Media.\n\n\"I think going in, we knew the narrative no matter what was going to happen was that they were going to say Carly had a big night, no matter what, and obviously they said that,\" Walker said. \"I think the other impression was \u2014 the feedback I got from folks, not just the press but from across the country we talked to, was a frustration that there wasn't more talk \u2026 about issues.\"\n\nMore From Esquire\n\nOkay, he's right about one thing. The Carly's Big Night narrative was pretty much prefabricated even before they all took their places in front of the big airplane. (The way you know this is that her blatant lies about the fake Planned Parenthood videos, and her blatant ignorance about the American defense posture, are still being treated as \"sharp\" and \"forceful\" performance moments. I swear a lot of these pieces were written and saved in August.) But, sweet babby Jeebus, what a whinging little salamander Walker's become. He found himself tangled in his own incompetence on just about any major issue you can name. He's clarified more positions than Jeb! Bush has, which is saying a great deal. He's found that rousting singing grandmas and hiding in the tunnels beneath your state capitol building just isn't enough to get you heard over the cacophony of any campaign that also contains Donald Trump. Time's almost up, Sluggo. Get your ass in gear or get it back to Madison. Your day job's calling.", "\"Democrats in Congress must stand strong against any Republican attacks on women. No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "BY: Follow @Kredo0\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration is declining to inform Congress about the number of American citizens and troops killed by Iran and its terror proxies, according to a document provided to Congress and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nThe administration was repeatedly asked by Congress to release figures describing how many Americans and Israelis have been killed by Iran\u2019s military and terror activities since the country\u2019s 1979 revolution.\n\nIn a series of on-the-record responses obtained exclusively by the Free Beacon, and provided in written form to Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), Kerry sidestepped the questions on all of the three separate occasions he was asked to provide the figures.\n\nThe questions come as the United States prepares to unfreeze more than $100 billion in Iranian assets under the terms of the recently inked nuclear deal.

And everybody, it seems, is telling tales out of school.\n\nSome of those on Thursday's donor call had expected different news. Many backers have directed their ire at campaign manager Rick Wiley, who some Walker supporters believe expanded the staff too quickly and has failed to calibrate spending during the summer fundraising season. A recent count put the number of full-time Walker campaign staff at around 90, and there have been no cutbacks in salaries as there were earlier this summer in former Florida governor Jeb Bush's operation. \"There is a substantial amount of chatter that he needs to go,\" said one major Walker fundraiser, requesting anonymity to discuss private conversations. \"People are worried.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n(Holy hell, the knives really are out.)\n\nWiley's lucky.

He found himself tangled in his own incompetence on just about any major issue you can name. He's clarified more positions than Jeb! Bush has, which is saying a great deal.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Shell will be allowed to freely spill oil into the ocean for three weeks, potentially wreaking environmental havoc on Canada's amazing marine life, major fishing grounds, coastal communities and the Sable Island National Park Reserve, the world's largest breeding colony of grey seals.\n\nNow it's down to the offshore oil regulator -- the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB) -- to decide whether to approve the application.\n\nIf our global community protests Shell's drilling Nova Scotia, we will send a signal that wherever it goes to drill and destroy, we'll be there too.\n\nTell the CNSOPB to refuse Shell's application to drill in Nova Scotia.\n\nOver four years, Shell wants to drill up to seven exploratory wells, which are especially risky and prone to large spill. If a blowout did happen, it would be catastrophic for Canada's major fishing grounds and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. requires oil companies to have blowout-capping equipment on site within 24 hours. Canada is giving Shell three weeks to bring equipment in from Norway after a blowout happens 5,000 kilometres away. And worse, some of the backup safety equipment is located in South Africa, a staggering 12,000 kilometres away.\n\n\n\nShell is not only gambling with Nova Scotia, it is wreaking havoc all over the world. It recently got the go ahead to drill the Arctic, putting our entire ecosystem in danger and contributing massively to climate change.\n\nBP's Deepwater Horizon disaster taught us just how devastating a prolonged blowout can be for wildlife, habitat and livelihoods. But some believe a blowout in Shell's wells in Nova Scotia, Canada could be even worse. The oil wells would be in much deeper water and a much harsher environment. And honestly, no one trusts Shell ability to deal with it.\n\nThe SumOfUs community has stood up to Big Oil's destruction of the environment, and we've had a major impact. Hundreds of thousands of us came together to stop Shell from drilling in the Arctic, and to demand that Chevron pay for its crimes in the Amazon.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "Scott Walker Was Coward During 2011 Wisconsin Protests\n\nPhoto Credit: https://www.scottwalker.com/\n\nOnce again at Wednesday\u2019s presidential debate, Wisconsin Gov.

The text has been amended with the correction of a factual error and includes responses throughout the piece from Sen. Reid\u2019s communications director, Adam Jentleson. Those passages appear in italics.\n\nCORRECTIONS: A previous version of the article said that the Bullhead City parcel did not appear on Sen. Reid\u2019s 2012 financial disclosure. In fact, the property is listed in the documents. Also, this article had said that Sen. Reid spent \u201capproximately eight years\u201d working as a private practice attorney. In fact, the correct span is at least 14 years between 1964 and 1982, while Reid also held several public offices. (His spokesman is unsure if he practiced law regularly while serving as lieutenant governor.)\n\nThe first of two parts\n\nLast month, as the Senate was busy negotiating the final details of its Ukraine aid package, Majority Leader Harry Reid became temporarily distracted with a campaign finance issue. Since winning re-election in 2010, Reid\u2019s campaign had purchased gifts for supporters and donors from vendors like Bed Bath & Beyond, Amazon, Nordstrom, and the Senate gift shop, among others. But one round of spending was directed to a less recognizable firm: Ryan Elisabeth, a jewelry line.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the campaign spent $31,267 purchasing gifts from the company, which is owned by Reid\u2019s granddaughter, Ryan Elisabeth Reid. All told, she took in nearly seven times more cash than all vendors of donor gifts combined during that period of time.\n\nVeteran Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston first reported the news after receiving a tip about the expenditures. (Ryan Elisabeth\u2019s last name did not appear on the FEC reports, and the senator\u2019s office initially failed to confirm her identity.) While Sen. Reid does not appear to have broken the law, he understood that the purchases created a perception of favoritism. Lamenting the unwanted attention heaped on his granddaughter, he decided after the news broke that \u201cit would be best to pay for her work out of my own pocket.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time that Reid had mixed family and politics -- or potentially run afoul of ethics rules.\n\nHarry Reid has spent more than 40 years in government, starting as a small city\u2019s attorney and eventually becoming the most powerful senator in the country. He has raised tens of millions of dollars in political contributions, established himself as an institution in Nevada politics along the way, and made himself a very wealthy man. His humble roots -- from growing up in a remote desert town to working six days a week as a Capitol police officer while in law school -- are legend in Washington and Nevada. Reid exhibits the toughness of a once destitute boy who completely transformed his life through determination, hard work -- and good luck.\n\nSome who have watched Reid closely over the years, however, say that his political and economic ascendance has made him increasingly willing to use his power (and apparent electoral resilience) in ways that appear unsavory or nepotistic. The jewelry purchases are only the latest example.\n\nDavid Damore -- a University of Nevada, Las Vegas professor whose research focuses on Silver State politics -- has closely followed Reid for years. He said that the balance between helping family and constituents is a common tension for powerful politicians. \u201cI\u2019m going to put this politely: Their personal interests, they seem to see, represent the common good. They don\u2019t differentiate those two.\u201d\n\nAnother longtime Reid-watcher believes that the latest string of incidents, stretching over the last decade, is just a result of more coverage of Reid -- and not a product of him changing his style.\n\n\u201cAs he\u2019s become more known and a much higher dollar target for his critics, anything he does to assist his family now pegs on the radar,\u201d said John L. Smith, a columnist who has written about Nevada politics for nearly as long as Reid has been in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed his personal method of operation throughout his whole career.\u201d\n\nSmith added, \u201cI can\u2019t see him ever denying his family a break or an opportunity if he could provide it. I guess that\u2019s just part of being a dad and a guy with a certain level of influence.\u201d\n\nNowhere is Reid\u2019s influence more profound than in his home state, where he has built a dizzying network of mutually beneficial political, personal, and business alliances. These associations benefit Reid, his family, his close friends, and, very often, the state that he loves. The sphere of influence took decades to create.\n\nAfter returning from law school at the George Washington University, Reid was hired as city attorney in Henderson (the southern Nevada city where he had attended high school and met his wife, Landra). In 1966, he ran for a position on a local hospital\u2019s board of trustees after, he recalled, being taken aback at the chairman of the board\u2019s rudeness.\n\nHe won the election and two years later sought a promotion to the Nevada Assembly. While in the Assembly, Reid further developed relationships with important players in state politics and began honing his image as a strong consumer advocate. After two busy years introducing a record number of bills, Nevadans elected Reid to be their 25th lieutenant governor. (He ran on a ticket with Mike O\u2019Callaghan, a close friend and mentor.)\n\nAt 31, the boy who had grown up in an alcoholic miner\u2019s cabin stood just a heartbeat away from becoming his state\u2019s most powerful politician. But Reid felt he could achieve even more.\n\nHe ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1974 but narrowly lost, despite the wide expectation that he would win. Reid later told The New Yorker, \u201cEverything was in my favor. But I was young and impulsive and I attacked everybody.\u201d A year later, he ran for mayor of Las Vegas and lost again, that time by a much wider margin. Reid collected himself, temporarily abandoning the pursuit of elective office, and worked as a lawyer in Las Vegas.\n\nBut he returned to public life in 1977 when O\u2019Callaghan, still governor, appointed his former second-in-command to be chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission. The job -- seen then as undesirable, difficult, and perhaps dangerous -- further burnished Reid\u2019s reputation as a tough and honorable public servant. While running the Gaming Commission, Reid publicly jousted with mob bosses, tried to choke someone for attempting to bribe him (in front of FBI agents who were filming the sting), and dealt with the aftermath of his wife discovering a bomb attached to the family car.\n\nBy the time he decided to run for a newly created House seat in 1982, Reid had standing as a politician with uniquely strong integrity -- and guts. He had taken on a powerful telephone company as a freshman in the Nevada Assembly, while also sponsoring innovative air pollution legislation. Nevadans also closely associated him with O\u2019Callaghan, by then a popular former governor nurturing a reformist legacy. Reid\u2019s show of strength and resilience during his Gaming Commission tenure rounded out his picaresque political profile. Still relatively young, he spent just two terms in the House before graduating to the Senate in 1987. He has been there ever since.\n\nBut Reid\u2019s political ascent didn\u2019t stop when he arrived at the upper chamber. A savvy behind-the-scenes player, he became Democratic whip in 1999. After alternating between majority whip and minority whip for several years, his caucus elected him minority leader in 2005. Democrats took control of the Senate after the 2006 midterm elections, and Reid has served as majority leader ever since. For most of the past decade, he has been the most powerful lawmaker in the United States Senate. He is also indisputably the most powerful politician in Nevada -- Democratic or Republican.", "A female zookeeper has been attacked and killed by a tiger at a New Zealand zoo.\n\n\n\nEmergency services were called to the Hamilton zoo, 127km south of Auckland on Sunday morning and police have confirmed the woman died at the scene.\n\n\u2014 Hamilton Zoo (@HamiltonZooNZ) We are deeply saddened to confirm the death of a female staff member today after an attack by one of the zoo\u2019s Sumatran tigers.

The index aims to measure aspects of prosperity that typical gross domestic product measurements don\u2019t include, such as entrepreneurship and opportunity, education, and social capital.\n\nRELATED: Measure of prosperity aims to go beyond GDP\n\nThe freedom scores are based on polling data from 2013 indicating citizens\u2019 satisfaction with their nation's handling of civil liberties, freedom of choice, tolerance of ethnic minorities, and tolerance of immigrants. Polling data were provided by Gallup World Poll Service. The index is notable for the way it measures how free people feel, unlike other freedom indices that measure freedom by comparing government policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good report for Obama,\u201d Legatum Institute spokeswoman Cristina Odone told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIn the 2010 report (which relied on data gathered in 2009), the U.S. was ranked ninth in personal freedom, but that ranking has since fallen to 21st, with several countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom passing the U.S.\n\nMORE: Pro-immigration reform right oppose Obama acting unilaterally\n\nThe nation\u2019s overall personal freedom score has declined by 17 percent since 2009, with a 22 percent drop in combined civil liberty and free choice contributing to that decline.\n\nOf the eight categories in the index, personal freedom was America's second lowest performance relative to other countries.

The perception of what freedom means in New Zealand, which has the highest personal freedom ranking, may vary from how Americans measure their own personal freedom. But regardless of how the U.S. compares to other countries, there is no denying that Americans felt less free in 2013 after four more years of Obama\u2019s presidency.

Jimmy Carter was an ineffective president who became an exemplary post-president. Bill Clinton appears to be the reverse. All sorts of unproven worst-case-scenario questions float around the web of connections between Bill\u2019s private work, Hillary Clinton\u2019s public role as secretary of State, the Clintons\u2019 quasi-public charity, and Hillary\u2019s noncompliant email system. But the best-case scenario is bad enough: The Clintons have been disorganized and greedy.\n\nThe news today about the Clintons all fleshes out, in one way or another, their lack of interest in policing serious conflict-of-interest problems that arise in their overlapping roles:\n\nThe New York Times has a report about the State Department\u2019s decision to approve the sale of Uranium mines to a Russian company that donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Global Initiative, and that a Russian investment bank promoting the deal paid Bill $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Bill Clinton has received $26 million in speaking fees from entities that also donated to the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reports, \u201c Twenty-two of the 37 corporations nominated for a prestigious State Department award \u2014 and six of the eight ultimate winners \u2014 while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State were also donors to the Clinton family foundation. \u201d\n\nAnd Reuters reports, \u201c Hillary Clinton's family's charities are refiling at least five annual tax returns after a Reuters review found errors in how they reported donations from governments, and said they may audit other Clinton Foundation returns in case of other errors. \u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign is batting down the darkest and most conspiratorial interpretation of these stories, and where this all leads remains to be seen. But the most positive interpretation is not exactly good.\n\nWhen you are a power couple consisting of a former president and a current secretary of State and likely presidential candidate, you have the ability to raise a lot of money for charitable purposes that can do a lot of good. But some of the potential sources of donations will be looking to get something in return for their money other than moral satisfaction or the chance to hobnob with celebrities. Some of them want preferential treatment from the State Department, and others want access to a potential future Clinton administration. To run a private operation where Bill Clinton will deliver a speech for a (huge) fee and a charity that raises money from some of the same clients is a difficult situation to navigate. To overlay that fraught situation onto Hillary\u2019s ongoing and likely future government service makes it all much harder.\n\nAnd yet the Clintons paid little to no attention to this problem. Nicholas Confessore described their operation as \u201ca sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest. It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.\u201d Indeed, as Ryan Lizza reported in 2012, Bill Clinton seemed to see the nexus between his role and his wife\u2019s as a positive rather than a negative:\n\nRegardless of Bill Clinton\u2019s personal feelings about Obama, it didn\u2019t take him long to see the advantages of an Obama Presidency. More than anyone, he pushed Hillary to take the job of Secretary of State. \u201cPresident Clinton was a big supporter of the idea,\u201d an intimate of the Clintons told me. \u201cHe advocated very strongly for it and arguably was the tie-breaking reason she took the job.\u201d For one thing, having his spouse in that position didn\u2019t hurt his work at the Clinton Global Initiative. He invites foreign leaders to the initiative\u2019s annual meeting, and her prominence in the Administration can be an asset in attracting foreign donors. \u201cBill Clinton\u2019s been able to continue to be the Bill Clinton we know, in large part because of his relationship with the White House and because his wife is the Secretary of State,\u201d the Clinton associate continued. \u201cIt worked out very well for him. That may be a very cynical way to look at it, but that\u2019s a fact. A lot of the stuff he\u2019s doing internationally is aided by his level of access.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration wanted Hillary Clinton to use official government email. She didn\u2019t. The Obama administration also demanded that the Clinton Foundation disclose all its donors while she served as Secretary of State. It didn\u2019t comply with that request, either.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 charitable initiatives were a kind of quasi-government run by themselves, which was staffed by their own loyalists and made up the rules as it went along. Their experience running the actual government, with its formal accountability and disclosure, went reasonably well. Their experience running their own privatized mini-state has been a fiasco.", "\"Low-wage hourly workers, especially single parents, face unpredictable and erratic work schedules, which greatly impact their families and livelihoods. Pass the Schedules That Work Act now.\"\n\nThe petition to the U.S. Congress reads:\n\nMillions of low-wage hourly workers, many of whom are parents, are given erratic and unpredictable work schedules by their employers. Work hours like these make it almost impossible to schedule childcare, work at a second job, or go back to school.\n\nRight now, retailers and restaurants are legally allowed to change employees\u2019 schedules at a moment\u2019s notice, without recourse or regard to a worker\u2019s personal situation. But new legislation introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren would end this once and for all. Sen. Warren\u2019s bill, the Schedules That Work Act, would allow employees to have a say in their work schedule and bring more stability to their family\u2019s lives.\n\nWithout basic workplace protections, these workers are one small personal emergency away from losing their jobs and falling more deeply into poverty. We must pressure Congress to protect workers\u2019 access to fair and predictable schedules.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Schedules That Work Act now.\n\nSpecifically, Sen. Warren\u2019s legislation would require employers to:\n\nGive workers with specifics needs, like childcare or health issues, more protections;\n\nAllow employees the right to ask for better schedules to suit their family's needs;\n\nStop retaliating against employees for making work requests;\n\nProvide clear and advance expectations for work schedules, including number of hours or on-call shifts.\n\nThe biggest beneficiaries to predictable schedules may in fact be children. According to a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute, young children of workers who have nonstandard or unpredictable work schedules \u201care more likely to have inferior cognitive and behavioral outcomes.\u201d1\n\nAnd there\u2019s momentum behind giving low-wage workers better schedules. Major retailers including Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Williams-Sonoma are phasing out last minute on-call scheduling, and Starbucks has announced it will be bringing \u201cmore stability and consistency\u201d to workers\u2019 schedules.2\n\nBut not all retailers, restaurants, and other hourly employers have followed suit. That\u2019s why we must increase the pressure on Congress to pass this important legislation and give all workers the benefit of a stable and consistent schedule.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Schedules That Work Act now.\n\nThanks for all you do to stand up for workers.\n\nReferences:", "Americans' assessments of their personal freedom have significantly declined under President Obama, according to a new study from the Legatum Institute in London, and the United States now ranks below 20 other countries on this measure.\n\nThe research shows that citizens of countries including France, Uruguay, and Costa Rica now feel that they enjoy more personal freedom than Americans.\n\nAs the Washington Examiner reported this morning, representatives of the Legatum Institute are in the U.S. this week to promote the sixth edition of their Prosperity Index. The index aims to measure aspects of prosperity that typical gross domestic product measurements don\u2019t include, such as entrepreneurship and opportunity, education, and social capital.\n\nRELATED: Measure of prosperity aims to go beyond GDP\n\nThe freedom scores are based on polling data from 2013 indicating citizens\u2019 satisfaction with their nation's handling of civil liberties, freedom of choice, tolerance of ethnic minorities, and tolerance of immigrants. Polling data were provided by Gallup World Poll Service. The index is notable for the way it measures how free people feel, unlike other freedom indices that measure freedom by comparing government policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good report for Obama,\u201d Legatum Institute spokeswoman Cristina Odone told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIn the 2010 report (which relied on data gathered in 2009), the U.S. was ranked ninth in personal freedom, but that ranking has since fallen to 21st, with several countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom passing the U.S.\n\nMORE: Pro-immigration reform right oppose Obama acting unilaterally\n\nThe nation\u2019s overall personal freedom score has declined by 17 percent since 2009, with a 22 percent drop in combined civil liberty and free choice contributing to that decline.\n\nOf the eight categories in the index, personal freedom was America's second lowest performance relative to other countries. The U.S. had its lowest ranking when it came to safety and security (a broad measure of how threatened citizens feel in instances such as walking late at night, or expressing their opinions) \u2014 ranking 31st out of 142 countries.\n\nThe cross-country comparisons in the index should be taken with a grain of salt. The perception of what freedom means in New Zealand, which has the highest personal freedom ranking, may vary from how Americans measure their own personal freedom. But regardless of how the U.S. compares to other countries, there is no denying that Americans felt less free in 2013 after four more years of Obama\u2019s presidency. And so now he faces the embarrassment of being the president that made Americans feel less free than the French.", "\"Democrats in Congress must stand strong against any Republican attacks on women. No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "https://t.co/xxxxxxxxx #news #p2 RT @HillaryClinton .@POTUS is right: When we ensure black women and girls have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, America gets ahead. -H\n\n\n\nReply \u00b7 Report Post", "", "Story highlights Hillary Clinton fired up the most faithful Granite State Democrats on Saturday\n\nThe event is the largest Democratic state party convention in New Hampshire's history\n\nManchester, New Hampshire (CNN) Hillary Clinton fired up the most faithful Granite State Democrats on Saturday, outlining her vision for the future and the rationale behind her run in a well received speech at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's convention here.\n\n\"If you want a president who will tell you everything that is wrong with America and who is to blame for it, you've got plenty of other choices.

The text has been amended with the correction of a factual error and includes responses throughout the piece from Sen. Reid\u2019s communications director, Adam Jentleson. Those passages appear in italics.\n\nCORRECTIONS: A previous version of the article said that the Bullhead City parcel did not appear on Sen. Reid\u2019s 2012 financial disclosure. In fact, the property is listed in the documents. Also, this article had said that Sen. Reid spent \u201capproximately eight years\u201d working as a private practice attorney. In fact, the correct span is at least 14 years between 1964 and 1982, while Reid also held several public offices. (His spokesman is unsure if he practiced law regularly while serving as lieutenant governor.)\n\nThe first of two parts\n\nLast month, as the Senate was busy negotiating the final details of its Ukraine aid package, Majority Leader Harry Reid became temporarily distracted with a campaign finance issue. Since winning re-election in 2010, Reid\u2019s campaign had purchased gifts for supporters and donors from vendors like Bed Bath & Beyond, Amazon, Nordstrom, and the Senate gift shop, among others. But one round of spending was directed to a less recognizable firm: Ryan Elisabeth, a jewelry line.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the campaign spent $31,267 purchasing gifts from the company, which is owned by Reid\u2019s granddaughter, Ryan Elisabeth Reid. All told, she took in nearly seven times more cash than all vendors of donor gifts combined during that period of time.\n\nVeteran Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston first reported the news after receiving a tip about the expenditures. (Ryan Elisabeth\u2019s last name did not appear on the FEC reports, and the senator\u2019s office initially failed to confirm her identity.) While Sen. Reid does not appear to have broken the law, he understood that the purchases created a perception of favoritism. Lamenting the unwanted attention heaped on his granddaughter, he decided after the news broke that \u201cit would be best to pay for her work out of my own pocket.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time that Reid had mixed family and politics -- or potentially run afoul of ethics rules.\n\nHarry Reid has spent more than 40 years in government, starting as a small city\u2019s attorney and eventually becoming the most powerful senator in the country. He has raised tens of millions of dollars in political contributions, established himself as an institution in Nevada politics along the way, and made himself a very wealthy man. His humble roots -- from growing up in a remote desert town to working six days a week as a Capitol police officer while in law school -- are legend in Washington and Nevada. Reid exhibits the toughness of a once destitute boy who completely transformed his life through determination, hard work -- and good luck.\n\nSome who have watched Reid closely over the years, however, say that his political and economic ascendance has made him increasingly willing to use his power (and apparent electoral resilience) in ways that appear unsavory or nepotistic. The jewelry purchases are only the latest example.\n\nDavid Damore -- a University of Nevada, Las Vegas professor whose research focuses on Silver State politics -- has closely followed Reid for years. He said that the balance between helping family and constituents is a common tension for powerful politicians. \u201cI\u2019m going to put this politely: Their personal interests, they seem to see, represent the common good. They don\u2019t differentiate those two.\u201d\n\nAnother longtime Reid-watcher believes that the latest string of incidents, stretching over the last decade, is just a result of more coverage of Reid -- and not a product of him changing his style.\n\n\u201cAs he\u2019s become more known and a much higher dollar target for his critics, anything he does to assist his family now pegs on the radar,\u201d said John L. Smith, a columnist who has written about Nevada politics for nearly as long as Reid has been in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed his personal method of operation throughout his whole career.\u201d\n\nSmith added, \u201cI can\u2019t see him ever denying his family a break or an opportunity if he could provide it. I guess that\u2019s just part of being a dad and a guy with a certain level of influence.\u201d\n\nNowhere is Reid\u2019s influence more profound than in his home state, where he has built a dizzying network of mutually beneficial political, personal, and business alliances. These associations benefit Reid, his family, his close friends, and, very often, the state that he loves. The sphere of influence took decades to create.\n\nAfter returning from law school at the George Washington University, Reid was hired as city attorney in Henderson (the southern Nevada city where he had attended high school and met his wife, Landra). In 1966, he ran for a position on a local hospital\u2019s board of trustees after, he recalled, being taken aback at the chairman of the board\u2019s rudeness.\n\nHe won the election and two years later sought a promotion to the Nevada Assembly. While in the Assembly, Reid further developed relationships with important players in state politics and began honing his image as a strong consumer advocate. After two busy years introducing a record number of bills, Nevadans elected Reid to be their 25th lieutenant governor. (He ran on a ticket with Mike O\u2019Callaghan, a close friend and mentor.)\n\nAt 31, the boy who had grown up in an alcoholic miner\u2019s cabin stood just a heartbeat away from becoming his state\u2019s most powerful politician. But Reid felt he could achieve even more.\n\nHe ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1974 but narrowly lost, despite the wide expectation that he would win. Reid later told The New Yorker, \u201cEverything was in my favor. But I was young and impulsive and I attacked everybody.\u201d A year later, he ran for mayor of Las Vegas and lost again, that time by a much wider margin. Reid collected himself, temporarily abandoning the pursuit of elective office, and worked as a lawyer in Las Vegas.\n\nBut he returned to public life in 1977 when O\u2019Callaghan, still governor, appointed his former second-in-command to be chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission. The job -- seen then as undesirable, difficult, and perhaps dangerous -- further burnished Reid\u2019s reputation as a tough and honorable public servant. While running the Gaming Commission, Reid publicly jousted with mob bosses, tried to choke someone for attempting to bribe him (in front of FBI agents who were filming the sting), and dealt with the aftermath of his wife discovering a bomb attached to the family car.\n\nBy the time he decided to run for a newly created House seat in 1982, Reid had standing as a politician with uniquely strong integrity -- and guts. He had taken on a powerful telephone company as a freshman in the Nevada Assembly, while also sponsoring innovative air pollution legislation. Nevadans also closely associated him with O\u2019Callaghan, by then a popular former governor nurturing a reformist legacy. Reid\u2019s show of strength and resilience during his Gaming Commission tenure rounded out his picaresque political profile. Still relatively young, he spent just two terms in the House before graduating to the Senate in 1987. He has been there ever since.\n\nBut Reid\u2019s political ascent didn\u2019t stop when he arrived at the upper chamber. A savvy behind-the-scenes player, he became Democratic whip in 1999. After alternating between majority whip and minority whip for several years, his caucus elected him minority leader in 2005. Democrats took control of the Senate after the 2006 midterm elections, and Reid has served as majority leader ever since. For most of the past decade, he has been the most powerful lawmaker in the United States Senate. He is also indisputably the most powerful politician in Nevada -- Democratic or Republican.", "BY: Follow @Kredo0\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration is declining to inform Congress about the number of American citizens and troops killed by Iran and its terror proxies, according to a document provided to Congress and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nThe administration was repeatedly asked by Congress to release figures describing how many Americans and Israelis have been killed by Iran\u2019s military and terror activities since the country\u2019s 1979 revolution.\n\nIn a series of on-the-record responses obtained exclusively by the Free Beacon, and provided in written form to Sen.

The index aims to measure aspects of prosperity that typical gross domestic product measurements don\u2019t include, such as entrepreneurship and opportunity, education, and social capital.\n\nRELATED: Measure of prosperity aims to go beyond GDP\n\nThe freedom scores are based on polling data from 2013 indicating citizens\u2019 satisfaction with their nation's handling of civil liberties, freedom of choice, tolerance of ethnic minorities, and tolerance of immigrants. Polling data were provided by Gallup World Poll Service. The index is notable for the way it measures how free people feel, unlike other freedom indices that measure freedom by comparing government policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good report for Obama,\u201d Legatum Institute spokeswoman Cristina Odone told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIn the 2010 report (which relied on data gathered in 2009), the U.S. was ranked ninth in personal freedom, but that ranking has since fallen to 21st, with several countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom passing the U.S.\n\nMORE: Pro-immigration reform right oppose Obama acting unilaterally\n\nThe nation\u2019s overall personal freedom score has declined by 17 percent since 2009, with a 22 percent drop in combined civil liberty and free choice contributing to that decline.\n\nOf the eight categories in the index, personal freedom was America's second lowest performance relative to other countries. The U.S. had its lowest ranking when it came to safety and security (a broad measure of how threatened citizens feel in instances such as walking late at night, or expressing their opinions) \u2014 ranking 31st out of 142 countries.\n\nThe cross-country comparisons in the index should be taken with a grain of salt. The perception of what freedom means in New Zealand, which has the highest personal freedom ranking, may vary from how Americans measure their own personal freedom. But regardless of how the U.S. compares to other countries, there is no denying that Americans felt less free in 2013 after four more years of Obama\u2019s presidency. And so now he faces the embarrassment of being the president that made Americans feel less free than the French.", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse. Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\"", "MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 About two months ago, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley made it the mission of his presidential campaign to start a debate over the debates.\n\nHe spent the summer calling for more debates, and calling on others to call for more debates. He printed new campaign signs with a debate slogan (\u201cWe Need Debate\u201d), joined a debate protest outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, and accused the party chair of autocratically devising a \u201crigged\u201d debate system that would benefit Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn Saturday, at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, O\u2019Malley witnessed one of his biggest victories yet: Dozens of attendees rallied the hall into boos and chants for more debates during a speech by the DNC chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. \u201cC\u2019mon, folks. We\u2019re all on the same side,\u201d she said over the noise.\n\nBut when it was his turn to take the podium, O\u2019Malley did not talk about the Democratic debates, or the \u201cWe Need Debate\u201d campaign, or the supporters who helped interrupt Wasserman-Schultz earlier in the day. He gave his standard speech, hitting on his record as governor of Maryland, his 15 \u201cstrategic goals to rebuild the American Dream\u201d \u2014 and only alluded to the issue with a few passing references to the \u201cunanswered\u201d Republican debates.\n\nAfterward, reporters wanted to know: Where was the victory lap!\n\n\u201cLocal democrats and media members were wondering,\u201d one asked, \u201cwhy not make that more of a focal point with the crowd being obviously be so into that message?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley, still polling in the low single-digits, appeared eager to remind his questioner that his campaign is not, in fact, a campaign for more Democratic debates. It is a campaign for president.\n\n\u201cThe theme of my campaign is not about process. It\u2019s about the actions that we need to take to help rebuild the American dream, and make wages go up rather than down,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, standing with a few aides backstage at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s what I focus on wherever I speak. When I jump up on a chair I often will mention that we should be having more debates rather than fewer.\u201d\n\nThe scene at the convention, where five of the six Democratic candidates spoke after Wasserman-Schultz, signaled both the success of O\u2019Malley\u2019s debate over the debates, and the challenge that now poses to his candidacy, having made a matter of \u201cprocess\u201d such a prominent part of his campaign message.\n\nOn Saturday, O\u2019Malley recognized that the debate question will come and go: Wasserman-Schultz, under added pressure from statements against the setup by Nancy Pelosi and the DNC\u2019s two vice chairs, will either add to the six scheduled debates, or she will not. Then, the debates will happen. The first one is next month.\n\nO\u2019Malley, as he put it backstage, plans to keep talking about the questions that comprise the center of his campaign \u2014 questions, he said, that do not involve debates.\n\n\u201cThe center of my campaign is not about a process. It\u2019s about a country. Our country. And what we need to do to create a better life for our kids,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for why he didn\u2019t highlight the debates in his speech on Saturday, O\u2019Malley noted that the convention marked the first time the candidates appeared at the same event in New Hampshire. (Clinton spoke first, followed by O\u2019Malley; Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont; Lincoln Chafee, the former governor and senator from Rhode Island; and Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard Law professor. Jim Webb, another Democratic candidate, did not attend.)\n\n\u201cThe issue of having more debates is certainly an important one,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cAnd certainly the crowd made their opinion known when the chair spoke.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign zeroed in on the debate issue in August, when the DNC released a slate of dates and locations for six debates. Under the current plan, four come before the caucuses and primaries begin \u2014 including one debate in Iowa, home to the first caucuses, and one debate in New Hampshire, home to the first primary. In 2008, as his campaign has pointed out, Democrats held two debates in Iowa before the caucuses, and three in New Hampshire before the primary.\n\nO\u2019Malley argued that the schedule unfairly benefited Clinton, who, at the time, still led Sanders in early-state polling. His campaign\u2019s lawyer has also questioned the legality of the DNC\u2019s so-called \u201cexclusivity clause,\u201d which bars candidates from participating in unsanctioned non-party debates.\n\nAt a DNC meeting last month, with Wasserman-Schultz seated on stage just paces away, O\u2019Malley delivered a speech largely dedicated to attacking the schedule. While the Republicans criticize Democrats at their own debates, O\u2019Malley said, \u201cwe respond\u2026 with crickets, tumbleweeds, a cynical move to delay and limit our own party debates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is totally unprecedented in our party history,\u201d he said. \u201cThis sort of rigged process this has never been attempted before.\u201d\n\nSanders has since joined O\u2019Malley\u2019s effort. And Clinton, who for weeks declined to engage much at all with the issue when asked, said earlier this month that she would be open to more debates. \u201cI have made it clear that if they want to do more, I\u2019m happy to do them,\u201d Clinton said during an appearance on CNN this week.\n\nOn Saturday, speaking with reporters after his speech, O\u2019Malley argued that the party, and all its candidates, would suffer for every Republican debate without a Democratic counterpart. \u201cWy would you turn over the microphone?\u201d he said. \u201cI think most Democrats are pretty upset by it, and the DNC members themselves were never even consulted. This was a one-woman edict.\u201d\n\nAnd what about his campaign, a reporter asked.

(ATI) at 12 mills in six states has entered its sixth week. ATI locked out workers on August 14 after rebuffing offers by the United Steelworkers (USW) union to hand over tens of millions of dollars in concessions, and after the USW ordered its members to continue to work past the June 30 contract deadline.\n\nThe locked-out workers are being deliberately isolated by the USW, which has ordered 30,000 workers at US Steel and ArcelorMittal to continue working without contracts after they expired on September 1.\n\nIn addition, 450 steelworkers at Sherwin Alumina in Gregory, Texas remain locked out after more than 11 months. This past week the USW offered more concessions to the aluminum producer, which rejected them because it is seeking even deeper cuts. While Sherwin Alumina has continued to operate the plant with scab labor, the USW has also left these workers completely isolated, holding only a few meaningless \u201csolidarity\u201d publicity stunts.\n\nATI is demanding steep increases in out-of-pocket health care expenses and the elimination of employer-paid pensions for new hires, creating a two-tier wage and benefits system. ATI wants to impose work rule changes that would essentially turn workers into casual laborers. In addition, ATI wants to vastly expand the use of outside contractors as a lower paid tier of workers that they can exploit even more ruthlessly than full-time employees.\n\nPicketers at ATI's Vandergrift mill from left to right: Janice with 10 years, Kathy Vargo, the wife of a recently-retired steelworker and Josh Fennell with 7 years\n\nJosh Fennell, a steelworker at ATI Vandergrift with seven years, noted the financial hardships imposed by an extended, isolated lockout. \u201cIt could go either way. It all depends on where people are financially. My wife works. We\u2019re going to be all right, the bills are going be paid. We\u2019re not going to do much else. Now, people we work with, some of them are the only source of income.\u201d\n\nJosh noted that he was forced into excessive overtime leading up the lockout. \u201cI did five or six hundred hours of overtime last year. Actually, I just looked at our last paycheck, and I\u2019m already at 300 this year. Before we got locked out, I was on 12-hour shifts. My last three weeks of work I was 76 hours, 72 hours, 78 hours.\u201d\n\nWorkers report that, thanks in large part to their forced overtime, ATI has stockpiled enough steel to last for months.\n\nJosh spoke of his opposition to ATI\u2019s concession demands. \u201cThe health care obviously is big, but all the news outlets are reporting that it\u2019s health care and health care only. It\u2019s far from that. I think a lot of the media is bought by the company. No doubt in my mind. You see a lot of media that way, they side with the company.\u201d\n\nJosh strenuously opposed lower pay and benefits for new hires, saying it would create a split between new and current workers. \u201cThey want to take away pensions from new hires and reduce them to strictly 401(k)s that they can keep when they leave the company. What\u2019s their incentive to actually stay? I have seven years in. I don\u2019t want to leave now because in 23 I can retire.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to say this [lockout] doesn\u2019t happen three or four contracts from now, and a worker says, \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing to lose, I\u2019ll see you later.\u2019 Then we\u2019re going to have less people fighting for their rights. On top of that if workers are divided new hires can say, \u2018Well, you didn\u2019t care about us.\u2019 It\u2019s not like that, however, a lot of us do care about the younger workers.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if ATI is bringing Strom Engineering scabs into the Vandergrift mill, Josh responded, \u201cYes they are, a white van just left. There\u2019s seven vans a day, seven a shift. They\u2019re not all full. Usually one of them is full and the others have two or three each.\u201d\n\nAsked what he thought of a united struggle of steel, auto and communication workers, Josh responded, \u201cOverall, I think this is the time where everybody needs to, for lack of a better term, fight the system. This is the chance, because we\u2019re all up right now. It couldn\u2019t have been a more opportune time to really go against the corporate greed of America.\u201d\n\nKathy Vargo, the wife of a recently retired steelworker who joined the picket line, said, \u201cI come here to show my support any time I can. My great grandmother marched with Fannie Sellins (a mineworkers organizer) who was murdered in 1919 near the plant gate in Brackenridge. There was a coal mine and the miners were on strike. Basically she was working to keep the Polish and Slovak women and families together with food and clothing so the men could strike. My great grandmother had come here to work in the mines too. She went to the gate and applied for the job by saying, \u2018Big hands, strong as a bull.\u2019 There she became active in the union.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on conditions at the Vandergrift mill, Kathy explained, \u201cLuckily my children are older, but for the last 15 years there has been no such thing as the eight hour day. The company was always forcing them to work overtime. You couldn\u2019t plan a birthday party or go to a school function because you didn\u2019t know if he would be home or not. I really feel for the young families because you can\u2019t have any kind of family life.\n\n\u201cThe company wants to go back to day labor, when they just hired you when they needed you. That was what my great grandmother was fighting against and we can\u2019t go back to that.\u201d\n\nJanice, with 10 years at the mill, said, \u201cI have one of the longest commutes of my coworkers. I am from the Mon Valley. I have been in manufacturing my whole life. When I graduated from high school in 1977, you could do whatever you wanted to do. If you wanted to be a steelworker, you could be a steelworker. If you wanted to be a coal miner, you could be a coal miner. If you wanted to be an autoworker, you could be an autoworker. The future was open.\n\n\u201cThat is all gone. The steel mills are all gone, construction is all gone. Anything that paid a good wage is gone. There are no jobs here. When I go home it is so sad that everything is boarded up. I am 56, I am a grandmother and I am concerned with the future of my grandchildren.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "As the Free Beacon reported:\n\nMedian household income declined to $53,657 in 2014, a figure 6.5 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the recession began, and 1.5 percent lower than last year, according to data released Wednesday from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2014, median household incomes declined by $3,700.

Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\"", "The U.S. Justice Department has awarded the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the official trade association of the firearms industry, $2.4 million for its \u201cProject ChildSafe\u201d program, which it says protects children by supplying gunlocks to households.\n\nGunlocks are important, but there are other giveaway programs the DOJ could support. Just as important is advancing gun safety policies, against which the NSSF has been one of the strongest opponents.\n\n\n\nAt a time when more than 20,000 children go to the emergency room every year with gun injuries, the NSSF has been forcefully advocating for loosening gun laws and getting firearms into as many hands as possible to expand gun sales. It opposes universal background checks, and works to \u201crebrand\u201d military-bred assault rifles like the AR-15 and AK-47 as \u201cmodern sporting rifles.\u201d Just this summer, it joined the NRA in suing Seattle over a sales tax on guns and ammunition designed to help offset the costs of gun violence in the city.\n\nBy giving public safety grants to NSSF, the DOJ only helps the gun industry project an image of being committed to gun safety, when in reality its top commitment is to expanding gun sales. In a nation where 33,000 Americans die each year from guns, our tax dollars should be spent supporting those working to reduce gun violence, not helping to facilitate it.", "GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina likes to portray herself as a hard-liner on Iran. However, during Fiornia\u2019s six-year tenure at Hewlett-Packard between 1999 and 2005, the company sold more than $100 million worth of computers and other high-tech equipment to Iranian customers, despite US export sanctions at the time. It\u2019s a small detail she has neglected to mention while on the campaign trail.\n\nHow did HP do it? The usual corporate schemes: the products were channeled through one of HP\u2019s European subsidiaries, and sold through an IT distributor in Dubai, known as Reddington Gulf. The sales continued long after HP sacked Fiorina. By 2007, more than 40% of printers sold in Iran bore the HP trademark.\n\nHP had started skirting Iran sanctions in 1997, two years before Fiorina came on board. By that time, sanctions imposed by the Clinton Administration had been in place for two years. However, there was a loophole in the law that allowed HP to do business in Iran \u201clegally,\u201d albeit indirectly. Under the rules in place at the time, foreign subsidiaries of American companies were considered outside of US jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the issue came to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2009 because of concerns that the equipment might be used for military or terrorism-related purposes. HP\u2019s legal department claimed that, because the subsidiaries were not \u201cUnited States [corporate] person(s),\u201d they were not subject to US sales restrictions.\n\nFiorina continued the HP scheme to get computers to Iran after she took over as CEO. Her compliance in violating US sanctions against Iran was highlighted in the Boston Globe in 2008 when Fiorina was attempting to unseat California Senator Barbara Boxer. The issue torpedoed her campaign then \u2013 and it could very well sink Fiorina again. Senator Boxer thought so when she told MSNBC: \u201cSo she\u2019s got so many problems. I say if the Republicans choose her, we\u2019ll walk into the presidency.\u201d\n\nDuring the first GOP debate, Fiorina declared that on her first day in office she would call Iranian leader Ali Khameni with the following message: \u201cUntil you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around.\u201d As CEO of Hewlett-Packard, however, Fiorina had no problem with Iran moving money into her own company\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt reminds us of another American businessman-turned Republican politician who got wealthy doing business with a government hostile toward the US. His name was Prescott Bush \u2013 and the country in which he was doing business was Nazi Germany.\n\nSome things never change\u2026", "By The Right Scoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio was on with Mark Levin tonight to talk Cuba and gave the best interview I\u2019ve heard yet on Cuba from anyone. One of my favorite parts was where he listed four of five reasons why Obama\u2019s new policy toward Cuba won\u2019t help the Cuban people, one being based on how Cuba\u2019s economy is set up so that 90% of all money in Cuba gets taken by the military because nothing is privately owned. Rubio is really quite impressive in his knowledge of Cuba.\n\nHe also explains how bad the human rights situation is in Cuba, noting that basically the day before this deal was announced, the Cuban coast guard rammed a boat of migrants that was trying to escape Cuba and one of the passengers is still missing and presumed dead.\n\nAnd there\u2019s much more.\n\nThe interview runs almost 15 minutes but it\u2019s definitely worth listening to it in its entirety.\n\nListen:\n\n\n\n", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse. Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

There is a segment of the population today that hates America, its people, and the nation\u2019s founding document, but instead of packing up and leaving the country, they have tasked Republicans to punish the entire population by legislating that all Americans suffer their lifestyle founded on poverty, bigotry, ill-health, and religious ignorance. Although there are Americans who hate this nation across the country, it is the former Confederacy that is punishing the people because they failed in their attempt to destroy America of their rejection of the United States Constitution they claim to love.\n\nSouthern states are still resentful they were unable to rip America apart because the Constitution forbade them from keeping dark-skinned human beings as livestock, so they spent the past 149 years punishing different groups of Americans based on their religion\u2019s instruction manual (Christian bible). Over the past thirty years, angry southerners began electing Republicans to strip everything from the people until they relented to a government by bible that drove their attempt to restrict other Americans from their Constitutional freedoms. Republicans have happily accommodated southerners to bring down the rest of the nation to their level of poverty and distress that southern red state voters embrace so long as they have imaginary enemies who believe Americans deserve more than slave wages, sickness, dire poverty, prayer, and firearms.\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge the former Confederacy considered owning human beings a biblically-supported and constitutional right according to their interpretation of the 10th Amendment. But even after losing the Civil War they persisted in targeting other groups for discrimination with biblical justification. Since their war against America, southern states opposed interracial marriage, women\u2019s right to vote, civil rights, voting rights, women\u2019s right to choose their reproductive health, and recently gay rights. The impetus for their opposition to those rights guaranteed in the Constitution is founded in their religion and since they were prohibited by the Constitution from depriving those groups of their rights, they have taken out their anger on the rest of the population by electing Republicans to Congress who promise to subject every American to conditions red southern state residents live under including poverty, slave wages, sickness and disease, and no hope of ever escaping their chosen lifestyle.\n\nIt is difficult for reasonable Americans to comprehend why voters in the South continue electing Republicans that campaign on perpetuating living conditions most Americans consider unacceptable. It is not because they believe all Americans live in poverty and love it, or that they are unaware their miserable plight is unavoidable. Most likely they are willing to live in poverty and ill-health with no chance of escaping because they are angry the rest of the nation will not tolerate their bigotry and hate; their only recourse is electing Republicans to legislate America into one big red state mired in bigotry, religion, guns, and deep poverty.\n\nAccording to The Department of Agriculture\u2019s measure of poverty, every red state from Arizona to South Carolina has the highest poverty rates in America; between 17.9% and 22.8%. The so-called bible belt is America\u2019s poverty belt including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, nearly one in four children trapped in Southern red states live in dire poverty and parents of those children elect Republicans to make those despicable statistics uniform across America. Part and parcel of conditions driving the South\u2019s poverty is low wages that voters elect Republicans to perpetuate across America.\n\nSouthern states are hostile to organized labor, five states have no state minimum wage, most are \u201cright to work for less\u201d states, and the 10 states with the lowest average incomes are in the former Confederacy including Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma according to the Equality of Economic Opportunity Project. Republicans in Congress promote policies that create poverty across the South and red state voters elect them anyway to subject the entire nation to low wages and the poverty they engender.\n\nThe depth of Southern voters\u2019 hatred for other Americans and their own families is evident in their support for Republicans that rejected expanding Medicaid in most of the South. According to a map by the Urban Institute, counties with the most people without healthcare insurance are in the Southern United States and it defies comprehension why voters support Republicans who prevent their children, parents, brothers and sisters from access to healthcare that does not cost states one cent for the first few years and only 10% (at most) thereafter. The same voters avidly oppose the Affordable Care Act that reveals they want tens-of-millions of Americans to suffer the same ill-health and disease they choose for their families.\n\nIt is unfathomable that residents in southern red states reject attempts to help them climb out of poverty and sickness, but religion and guns are powerful motivators for people still holding a grudge over being prevented from owning slaves, restricting women\u2019s rights, and discriminating against Americans according to their religious beliefs. It is no coincidence that the poorest Southern states are also the most religious and have the most firearm violence. In fact, the poorest states have the highest incidence of gun violence to go along with some of the highest gun ownership rates that Republicans take advantage of by joining the National Rifle Association fear mongering that President Obama is coming after their guns as fervently as he is coming after their religious liberty.\n\nMany pundits assert the conditions in southern red states are the fault of Republican-dominated legislatures, but without voters electing Republicans and teabaggers to preserve the deplorable conditions southern states would not lead the nation in poverty. Unfortunately, the same people electing Republicans at the state level vote for Republicans in Congress because they promise to oppose Democrats and President Obama\u2019s campaign to disarm Southern state residents\u2019 of their guns and bibles. It is certain that if President Obama and Democrats supported religious-driven bigotry and gun fanaticism, red southern state voters would reciprocate and support policies giving them decent wages, healthcare, and domestic programs to combat poverty. However, since that will never happen they will vote to elect Republicans to Congress to impose their deplorable living conditions on the entire population and spread their real America to every state in the Union.", "During the protests against America\u2019s involvement in the Viet Nam war, it became very popular for warmongers and so-called patriots to tell young men facing losing their lives in a worthless war and those protesting to save them that this is \u201cAmerica, love it or leave it.\u201d The implication was that since Congress adhered to the Constitution in waging war, regardless the devastating consequences, the American people were obliged to either show their love of country and support the war or get out.

Soldiers who served in the same unit with him call him a deserter. The key to this deal, however, is less likely to be what the United States got out of the deal than it is about what Barack Obama got out of the deal. If nothing else, it instantly got the veterans' hospitals scandals off the front pages of newspapers and pushed these scandals aside on television news programs.\n\nIt was a clear winner for Barack Obama. And that may be all that matters to Barack Obama.\n\nPeople who are questioning the president's competence seem not to want to believe that any President of the United States would knowingly damage this country's interests.\n\nOne of the problems of many fundamentally decent people is that they find it hard to understand people who are not fundamentally decent, or whose moral compass points in a different direction from theirs.\n\nMany people who are painfully disappointed with President Obama have no real reason to be. The man's whole previous history, from childhood on, was shaped by a whole series of people, beginning with his mother, whose vision of America was very much like that of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, whose church Barack Obama belonged to for 20 long years.\n\nObama is not a stupid man. There is no way that he could have sat in that church all that time without knowing how Jeremiah Wright hated America, and how his vision of the world was one in which \"white folks' greed runs a world in need.\"\n\nEven if the Reverend Wright had been the only such person in Barack Obama's life -- and he was not -- it should have been enough to keep him out of the White House.\n\n\"Innocent until proven guilty\" is a good rule in a court of law, which has the power to deprive a defendant of liberty or life. But it is mindless and dangerous nonsense to apply that standard outside that context -- especially when choosing a President of the United States, who holds in his hands the liberty and lives of millions of Americans.\n\nPeople who are disappointed with Barack Obama have no right to be. It is they whom others have a right to be disappointed with. Instead of taking their role as citizens seriously, they chose to vote on the basis of racial symbolism, glib rhetoric and wishful thinking.\n\nMoreover, many are already talking about choosing the next President of the United States on the basis of demographic symbolism -- to have \"the first woman president.\" And if she is elected on that basis, will any criticism of what she does in the White House be denounced as based on anti-woman bias, as criticisms of President Obama have been repeatedly denounced as racism?\n\nAnd what if we have the first Hispanic president or the first Jewish president? Will any criticism of their actions in the White House be silenced by accusations of prejudice?\n\nWe may yet become the first nation to die from a terminal case of frivolity. Other great nations in history have been threatened by barbarians at the gates. We may be the first to be threatened by self-indulgent silliness inside the gates.\n\nAs for Barack Obama, you cannot judge any President's competence by the results of his policies, without first knowing what he was trying to achieve.\n\nMany wise and decent people assume automatically that President Obama was trying to serve the interests of America.\n\nFrom that standpoint, he has failed abysmally, both at home and abroad. And that should legitimately call his competence into question.\n\nBut what if his vision of the world is one in which the wealth and power of those at the top, whether at home or internationally, are deeply resented, and have been throughout his life, under the tutelage of a whole series of resenters?\n\nAnd what if his goal is to redress that imbalance?\n\nWho can say that he has failed, when the fundamental institutions of this country have been successfully and perhaps irretrievably undermined, and when the positions of America and its allies on the world stage have been similarly, and even more dangerously, undermined around the world?", "Educating Joe Nocera on the Fed, Job Killing, and the Export-Import Bank\n\nJoe Nocera seems to be obsessed with promoting the Export-Import Bank. Today he put out at least his fourth column on the topic, although this time he did refrain from calling his opponents \"idiotic.\"\n\nHis story is that Republican opponents of the bank are \"job-killers.\" (I'm not sure if this also applies to us non-Republican opponents.) Let's think this one through for a moment.\n\nThe basic story is that we have huge companies like General Electric and Caterpillar that get the vast majority of the subsidized loans from the Ex-Im Bank. Does that sound like handouts to huge companies? Nope, Nocera tells us just because these huge companies get all the money doesn't mean that they are the beneficiaries:\n\n\"'At a time when we want to compete around the world, it is hard to believe what is happening in the U.S. Congress,' said Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric.\n\n\n\n\"'The ultimate irony is that we are on the verge of an American manufacturing renaissance,' bemoaned Jim McNerney, the chairman of Boeing. 'Yet this action is causing companies to start looking outside the U.S. instead.'\n\n\n\n\"'People complain that the bank only helps big companies,' said Doug Oberhelman, the chairman and C.E.O. of Caterpillar. 'A lot of our suppliers are small. They don\u2019t export, but we do. And if we aren\u2019t exporting, they aren\u2019t selling to us.\u201d He added, \u201cI find it staggering that we would put highly paid export-oriented jobs at risk.'\n\n\"What Oberhelman finds 'staggering,' Immelt finds 'hard to believe' and McNerney finds ironic is the refusal of Republican extremists \u2014 led by the House Financial Services Committee\u2019s chairman, Jeb Hensarling \u2014 to allow a vote on the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a vote that would pass in a landslide.\"\n\nOkay, this argument has the form of the government should give me money because it is not really about helping me, I will spend the money on a car, on clothes, and on restaurant meals. If the government doesn't give me money, then I won't spend this money and all the people who would have been employed by this spending will be out of jobs. So it's really about helping them, not me.\n\nIt's not surprising that the CEOs of Boeing, General Electric, and Caterpillar would make this sort of argument. It is a bit surprising that an established columnist with the country's leading newspaper would take it seriously.\n\nBut let's get beyond the silliness and look more closely at the economics of the situation. Some folks may have heard of the Federal Reserve Board. They considered raising interest rates last week, but ultimately decided not to. Had the Fed actually raised rates the point would have been to slow the economy and reduce the rate of job creation. In other words, the Fed would be raising rates because it is worried that we will have too many jobs. (If you don't understand this point then you need to do more homework. This is why the Fed raises rates.)\n\nNow back to the Ex-Im Bank. Suppose that the Republicans in Congress read Nocera's column, realize their stupidity, and rush out and reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. Boeing, Caterpillar, and General Electric then use their subsidized loans to boost their exports. This lead to more people working at these companies and also at their smaller suppliers. Is everyone happy?\n\nNot quite.\n\nOur friends at the Fed see the uptick in employment. (Actually, it will probably be too small to have a noticeable impact in the data, but let's play along.) They decide that employment growth is definitely getting out of hand and start jacking up interest rates. This means less car buying, less home construction, less private investment, and less infrastructure investment by state and local governments. Also, higher interest rates are likely to lead to a higher dollar, which means fewer exports and more imports. Since the Fed has an idea of what employment levels and job growth rates they are willing to accept, any boost to employment that results from subsidized loans from the Ex-Im Bank is likely to be offset by the job losses resulting from higher interest rates.\n\nAre the jobs that are created by the subsidized loans to Boeing, Caterpillar, and General Electric better jobs than the ones lost in the auto sector, construction industry and other interest rate sectors of the economy? Offhand, I have no idea. But if Nocera or anyone wants to make a serious argument for the Ex-Im Bank, they have to be able to tell us why the jobs created by these subsidies are better than the jobs that they displace. Until they can make this case, they don't have an argument for reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, just a lot of name-calling.", "On Thursdays Show; Bear wonders how much crack you have to be smoking in order to think Tootsie is the greatest movie ever made?

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Scott Walker boasted that he \u201ctook on union bosses from Washington\u201d in his 2011 effort to crush state public-employee union rights.\n\nBut according to a stunning, detailed new statement by a former top Republican legislative aide, it turns out that Walker isolated himself and hid in tightly controlled, heavily-guarded environments during the conflict covering six intense weeks in early 2011\u2014which directly contradicts his tall tale of courageously facing his adversaries.\n\n\u201cOur unintimidated governor continued to only participate in private events with the media excluded or tightly controlled,\u201d wrote Michael Boerger, former top aide to retired Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis, in a September 10 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion piece.\n\nUnintimidated is the title of Walker\u2019s fact-challenged biography that recounts fiercely battling tens of thousands of pro-labor advocates as he pushed Act 10 into law. The legislation stripped most Wisconsin employees of any practical rights to union representation.\n\nWalker\u2019s reliance on his oft-told tale of political courage did not help deliver a breakout performance to counter his slipping poll numbers at Wednesday\u2019s debate. But Boerger\u2019s astonishing account of a man who hid from his critics and the public\u2014but later boasted of facing down enemies\u2014could mark a turning point for his 2016 ambitions.\n\nAs Boerger noted in his recent Milwaukee Journal Sentinel op-ed, while Walker sat quivering in fear, Madison police reported virtually no violence despite crowds of up to 150,000 protesters who stayed peaceful throughout the protracted battle over the legislation.\n\nWalker is a promoting a national anti-labor agenda as a cornerstone of his presidential campaign. In March, he signed a \u201cright-to-work\u201d bill for Wisconsin despite repeated assurances to the public and in private to conservative labor leaders that such a bill would never reach his desk. More recently, he has called for federal right-to-work laws, which discourage union membership and suppress wages, banning federal employee unions and closing the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nEven those who know Walker best are not impressed with his latest anti-union plans. Milwaukee\u2019s Journal Sentinel, a conservative paper which endorsed Walker three times for governor, dismissed his call for \u201cAct 10 nationwide\u201d and basically called him a serial liar.\n\n\u201cIt is more politicking from a governor who as recently as last year when running for re-election called right-to-work a distraction, then proceeded to sign the legislation anyway when it passed the Legislature,\u201d it editorialized. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growing distrust of Walker are Boerger\u2019s revelations that reveal Walker was hardly \u201cunintimidated\u201d in confronting unions. Last winter, candidate Walker ridiculously said that his battle with unionists showed that he could stand up to ISIS terrorists.\n\nWalker has also repeatedly said that he showed leadership by pushing Republican legislative leaders to fully support Act 10, which Boerger resented. His op-ed opened, \u201cAs a front-row witness to the sad history of the passage of Act 10, I have to refute the notion currently being advanced by Gov. Scott Walker that he faced stiff opposition to his proposal from GOP legislative leaders.\u201d\n\nBoerger\u2019s comments reflect the bitterness of Republicans who feel that they took the brunt of criticism from voters and were forced to engage in extraordinary anti-democratic tactics to prevent a high-profile loss for the new governor under an international spotlight\u2014as the Madison rebellion coincided with a popular uprising in Egypt and captured international headlines and TV coverage. Despite the GOP legislators\u2019 willingness to bend the rules to pass Act 10 for Walker, they saw themselves as unappreciated by the governor.\n\n\u201cEvery day that spring, legislators had to run a gantlet of protesters and meet in public in the Capitol for committee meetings and legislative sessions,\u201d stated Boerger. \u201cMeanwhile, our unintimidated governor was making speeches in minutely controlled, private venues that often even excluded attendance by the media.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Walker was so petrified of any direct challenge that he initially planned to deliver his high-profile budget address away from the State Capitol in a more tightly-guarded site, Boerger said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, the governor even planned to give his budget address outside the Capitol in such a private, security-dominated venue. Unintimidated? It was GOP leaders who convinced the governor to appear in public, in the statehouse as every other governor has done.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first account that has revealed Walker\u2019s self-described profile in courage as a big lie. While Republican legislators often faced protesters in heated dialogue as they circulated around the Capitol, Walker remained cloistered in his heavily-guarded office and \u201cslunk to and from the state Capitol via underground tunnels\u201d with armed escorts, Guardian journalist Jeb Lund reported.\n\nAs Walker\u2019s presidential ambitions keep floundering, it is beginning to appear that he is fated to return his bunker at the Capitol\u2014where he hid when he first launched his attack on labor and nurtured his presidential ambitions. But this time, he would be hiding from everyone who he used to fan his presidential ambitions.", "", "It's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

There is a segment of the population today that hates America, its people, and the nation\u2019s founding document, but instead of packing up and leaving the country, they have tasked Republicans to punish the entire population by legislating that all Americans suffer their lifestyle founded on poverty, bigotry, ill-health, and religious ignorance. Although there are Americans who hate this nation across the country, it is the former Confederacy that is punishing the people because they failed in their attempt to destroy America of their rejection of the United States Constitution they claim to love.\n\nSouthern states are still resentful they were unable to rip America apart because the Constitution forbade them from keeping dark-skinned human beings as livestock, so they spent the past 149 years punishing different groups of Americans based on their religion\u2019s instruction manual (Christian bible). Over the past thirty years, angry southerners began electing Republicans to strip everything from the people until they relented to a government by bible that drove their attempt to restrict other Americans from their Constitutional freedoms. Republicans have happily accommodated southerners to bring down the rest of the nation to their level of poverty and distress that southern red state voters embrace so long as they have imaginary enemies who believe Americans deserve more than slave wages, sickness, dire poverty, prayer, and firearms.\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge the former Confederacy considered owning human beings a biblically-supported and constitutional right according to their interpretation of the 10th Amendment. But even after losing the Civil War they persisted in targeting other groups for discrimination with biblical justification. Since their war against America, southern states opposed interracial marriage, women\u2019s right to vote, civil rights, voting rights, women\u2019s right to choose their reproductive health, and recently gay rights. The impetus for their opposition to those rights guaranteed in the Constitution is founded in their religion and since they were prohibited by the Constitution from depriving those groups of their rights, they have taken out their anger on the rest of the population by electing Republicans to Congress who promise to subject every American to conditions red southern state residents live under including poverty, slave wages, sickness and disease, and no hope of ever escaping their chosen lifestyle.\n\nIt is difficult for reasonable Americans to comprehend why voters in the South continue electing Republicans that campaign on perpetuating living conditions most Americans consider unacceptable. It is not because they believe all Americans live in poverty and love it, or that they are unaware their miserable plight is unavoidable. Most likely they are willing to live in poverty and ill-health with no chance of escaping because they are angry the rest of the nation will not tolerate their bigotry and hate; their only recourse is electing Republicans to legislate America into one big red state mired in bigotry, religion, guns, and deep poverty.\n\nAccording to The Department of Agriculture\u2019s measure of poverty, every red state from Arizona to South Carolina has the highest poverty rates in America; between 17.9% and 22.8%. The so-called bible belt is America\u2019s poverty belt including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, nearly one in four children trapped in Southern red states live in dire poverty and parents of those children elect Republicans to make those despicable statistics uniform across America. Part and parcel of conditions driving the South\u2019s poverty is low wages that voters elect Republicans to perpetuate across America.\n\nSouthern states are hostile to organized labor, five states have no state minimum wage, most are \u201cright to work for less\u201d states, and the 10 states with the lowest average incomes are in the former Confederacy including Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma according to the Equality of Economic Opportunity Project. Republicans in Congress promote policies that create poverty across the South and red state voters elect them anyway to subject the entire nation to low wages and the poverty they engender.\n\nThe depth of Southern voters\u2019 hatred for other Americans and their own families is evident in their support for Republicans that rejected expanding Medicaid in most of the South. According to a map by the Urban Institute, counties with the most people without healthcare insurance are in the Southern United States and it defies comprehension why voters support Republicans who prevent their children, parents, brothers and sisters from access to healthcare that does not cost states one cent for the first few years and only 10% (at most) thereafter. The same voters avidly oppose the Affordable Care Act that reveals they want tens-of-millions of Americans to suffer the same ill-health and disease they choose for their families.\n\nIt is unfathomable that residents in southern red states reject attempts to help them climb out of poverty and sickness, but religion and guns are powerful motivators for people still holding a grudge over being prevented from owning slaves, restricting women\u2019s rights, and discriminating against Americans according to their religious beliefs. It is no coincidence that the poorest Southern states are also the most religious and have the most firearm violence. In fact, the poorest states have the highest incidence of gun violence to go along with some of the highest gun ownership rates that Republicans take advantage of by joining the National Rifle Association fear mongering that President Obama is coming after their guns as fervently as he is coming after their religious liberty.\n\nMany pundits assert the conditions in southern red states are the fault of Republican-dominated legislatures, but without voters electing Republicans and teabaggers to preserve the deplorable conditions southern states would not lead the nation in poverty. Unfortunately, the same people electing Republicans at the state level vote for Republicans in Congress because they promise to oppose Democrats and President Obama\u2019s campaign to disarm Southern state residents\u2019 of their guns and bibles. It is certain that if President Obama and Democrats supported religious-driven bigotry and gun fanaticism, red southern state voters would reciprocate and support policies giving them decent wages, healthcare, and domestic programs to combat poverty. However, since that will never happen they will vote to elect Republicans to Congress to impose their deplorable living conditions on the entire population and spread their real America to every state in the Union.", "On Thursdays Show; Bear wonders how much crack you have to be smoking in order to think Tootsie is the greatest movie ever made?

His numbers are plunging. His donors are fleeing. His campaign staff is turning swiftly into a Machiavellian papacy. And everybody, it seems, is telling tales out of school.\n\nSome of those on Thursday's donor call had expected different news. Many backers have directed their ire at campaign manager Rick Wiley, who some Walker supporters believe expanded the staff too quickly and has failed to calibrate spending during the summer fundraising season. A recent count put the number of full-time Walker campaign staff at around 90, and there have been no cutbacks in salaries as there were earlier this summer in former Florida governor Jeb Bush's operation. \"There is a substantial amount of chatter that he needs to go,\" said one major Walker fundraiser, requesting anonymity to discuss private conversations. \"People are worried.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n(Holy hell, the knives really are out.)\n\nWiley's lucky. The fat cats just want him fired. Usually, when somebody leaves a Scott Walker political operation, it's via perp walk. Even so, the list of people used and discarded by Scott Walker on the trail of slime he's followed into high office is long and distinguished. Of course, Scottie knows who's to blame for his current problems. It's The Media.\n\n\"I think going in, we knew the narrative no matter what was going to happen was that they were going to say Carly had a big night, no matter what, and obviously they said that,\" Walker said. \"I think the other impression was \u2014 the feedback I got from folks, not just the press but from across the country we talked to, was a frustration that there wasn't more talk \u2026 about issues.\"\n\nMore From Esquire\n\nOkay, he's right about one thing. The Carly's Big Night narrative was pretty much prefabricated even before they all took their places in front of the big airplane. (The way you know this is that her blatant lies about the fake Planned Parenthood videos, and her blatant ignorance about the American defense posture, are still being treated as \"sharp\" and \"forceful\" performance moments. I swear a lot of these pieces were written and saved in August.) But, sweet babby Jeebus, what a whinging little salamander Walker's become. He found himself tangled in his own incompetence on just about any major issue you can name. He's clarified more positions than Jeb! Bush has, which is saying a great deal. He's found that rousting singing grandmas and hiding in the tunnels beneath your state capitol building just isn't enough to get you heard over the cacophony of any campaign that also contains Donald Trump.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

A government that fails to care for our men and women on the frontlines is guilty of malpractice. A government that puts the needs of illegal aliens above U.S. veterans for political gain should be prosecuted for criminal neglect bordering on treason.\n\nCompare, contrast and weep:\n\nIn Sacramento, Calif., lawmakers are moving forward with a budget-busting plan to extend government-funded health insurance to at least 1.5 million illegal aliens.\n\nIn Los Angeles, federal bureaucrats callously canceled an estimated 40,000 diagnostic tests and treatments for American veterans with cancer and other illnesses to cover up a decade-long backlog.\n\nIn New York, doctors report that nearly 40 percent of their patients receiving kidney dialysis are illegal aliens. A survey of nephrologists in 44 states revealed that 65 percent of them treat illegal aliens with kidney disease.\n\nIn Memphis, a VA whistleblower reported that his hospital was using contaminated kidney dialysis machines to treat America's warriors. The same hospital previously had been investigated for chronic overcrowding at its emergency room, leading to six-hour waits or longer. Another watchdog probe found unconscionable delays in processing lab tests at the center. In addition, three patients died under negligent circumstances, and the hospital failed to enforce accountability measures.\n\nIn Arizona, illegal aliens incurred health care costs totaling an estimated $700 million in 2009.\n\nIn Phoenix, at least 40 veterans died waiting for VA hospitals and clinics to treat them, while government officials created secret waiting lists to cook the books and deceive the public about deadly treatment delays.\n\nAt the University of California at Berkeley, UC President Janet Napolitano (former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security) has offered $5 million in financial aid to illegal alien students. Across the country, 16 states offer in-state tuition discounts for illegal aliens: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington. In addition, the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and the University of Michigan Board of Regents all approved their own illegal alien tuition benefits.\n\nIn 2013, the nation's most selective colleges and universities had enrolled just 168 American veterans, down from 232 in 2011. Anti-war activists have waged war on military recruitment offices at elite campuses for years. The huge influx of illegal aliens in state universities is shrinking the number of state-subsidized slots for vets.\n\nIn 2013, the Obama Department of Homeland Security released 36,007 known, convicted criminal illegal aliens, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. The catch-and-release beneficiaries include thugs convicted of homicide, sexual assault, kidnapping, and thousands of drunk or drugged driving crimes.\n\nThe same Department of Homeland Security issued a report in 2009 that identified returning combat veterans as worrisome terrorist and criminal threats to America.\n\nIn Washington, Big Business and open-borders lobbyists are redoubling efforts to pass another massive illegal alien amnesty to flood the U.S. job market with low-wage labor.\n\nAcross the country, men and women in uniform returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan have higher jobless rates than the civilian population. The unemployment rate for new veterans has spiked to its worst levels, nearing 15 percent.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "", "By Thomas Sowell - June 10, 2014\n\nPeople are arguing about what the United States got out of the deal that swapped five top level terrorist leaders for one American soldier who was, at best, absent from his post in a war zone. Soldiers who served in the same unit with him call him a deserter. The key to this deal, however, is less likely to be what the United States got out of the deal than it is about what Barack Obama got out of the deal. If nothing else, it instantly got the veterans' hospitals scandals off the front pages of newspapers and pushed these scandals aside on television news programs.\n\nIt was a clear winner for Barack Obama. And that may be all that matters to Barack Obama.\n\nPeople who are questioning the president's competence seem not to want to believe that any President of the United States would knowingly damage this country's interests.\n\nOne of the problems of many fundamentally decent people is that they find it hard to understand people who are not fundamentally decent, or whose moral compass points in a different direction from theirs.\n\nMany people who are painfully disappointed with President Obama have no real reason to be. The man's whole previous history, from childhood on, was shaped by a whole series of people, beginning with his mother, whose vision of America was very much like that of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, whose church Barack Obama belonged to for 20 long years.\n\nObama is not a stupid man. There is no way that he could have sat in that church all that time without knowing how Jeremiah Wright hated America, and how his vision of the world was one in which \"white folks' greed runs a world in need.\"\n\nEven if the Reverend Wright had been the only such person in Barack Obama's life -- and he was not -- it should have been enough to keep him out of the White House.\n\n\"Innocent until proven guilty\" is a good rule in a court of law, which has the power to deprive a defendant of liberty or life. But it is mindless and dangerous nonsense to apply that standard outside that context -- especially when choosing a President of the United States, who holds in his hands the liberty and lives of millions of Americans.\n\nPeople who are disappointed with Barack Obama have no right to be. It is they whom others have a right to be disappointed with. Instead of taking their role as citizens seriously, they chose to vote on the basis of racial symbolism, glib rhetoric and wishful thinking.\n\nMoreover, many are already talking about choosing the next President of the United States on the basis of demographic symbolism -- to have \"the first woman president.\" And if she is elected on that basis, will any criticism of what she does in the White House be denounced as based on anti-woman bias, as criticisms of President Obama have been repeatedly denounced as racism?\n\nAnd what if we have the first Hispanic president or the first Jewish president?

Other great nations in history have been threatened by barbarians at the gates. We may be the first to be threatened by self-indulgent silliness inside the gates.\n\nAs for Barack Obama, you cannot judge any President's competence by the results of his policies, without first knowing what he was trying to achieve.\n\nMany wise and decent people assume automatically that President Obama was trying to serve the interests of America.\n\nFrom that standpoint, he has failed abysmally, both at home and abroad. And that should legitimately call his competence into question.\n\nBut what if his vision of the world is one in which the wealth and power of those at the top, whether at home or internationally, are deeply resented, and have been throughout his life, under the tutelage of a whole series of resenters?\n\nAnd what if his goal is to redress that imbalance?\n\nWho can say that he has failed, when the fundamental institutions of this country have been successfully and perhaps irretrievably undermined, and when the positions of America and its allies on the world stage have been similarly, and even more dangerously, undermined around the world?", "Pope Francis should tell victims of priest sex abuse and their families, and the entire church, that he will take necessary actions to right wrongs.\n\nTHERE was a time when I would have been among the throngs chanting \u201cViva la papa\u201d when Pope Francis arrives this week. However, as a survivor of priest sex abuse as a child, along with other survivors, I am experiencing very unsettling feelings about his presence in the United States. The pope symbolizes the dismal past and present response to the darkest era in the Catholic Church \u2014 that of sex crimes by clergy and the continued, systematic cover-up by bishops and popes.\n\nYes, Pope Francis is a breath of fresh air and brings a new tone. Taking care of our Earth is a worthy cause (\u201cOn Care for Our Common Home\u201d), and caring for the poor and downtrodden is admirable. Yet, I find that Francis is skirting an elephant that still remains largely unaddressed in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 2014, a Pew Research Center survey gave Pope Francis his lowest marks for not addressing priest sex abuse of children and adults. In the beginning of Pope Francis\u2019 reign in 2013, 70 percent of U.S. Catholics said that addressing the sex-abuse scandal should be \u201ca top priority\u201d for the new pope, far more than said the same about standing up for families and traditional moral values, spreading the Catholic faith or other issues.\n\nTo date, Pope Francis hasn\u2019t exposed one cleric who has committed or is concealing sex crimes. Nor has he ordered any of the world\u2019s 5,100 bishops to do so.\n\nFrancis is a powerful leader, able to make change quickly and effectively as he did in cleaning his own house, the Vatican, from corruption and financial mishandling. It really is time to address, once and for all, a major issue that still hangs as a dark cloud above the Catholic Church. Francis could put into effect immediate actions by ousting priests and bishops who cover up sex crimes. I propose five actions to get this done.\n\nStop immediately the transferring of proven or admitted priest sex offenders to poor countries to avoid criminal trial and consequences. Bishops have sent priest sex offenders who have exploited, raped and molested children to countries like Paraguay, Ecuador, Columbia, Brazil, Peru and Mexico. Pope Francis must stop this now from happening again, and he can.\n\nFrancis must defrock or demote, clearly and publicly, prelates who protect predators and endanger kids. An occasional quiet resignation and vague explanation, only after a massive diocesan scandal, isn\u2019t enough. That\u2019s been the pattern for centuries. And it doesn\u2019t deter cover-ups.\n\nFrancis must insist that bishops lobby for, not against, reforming secular child-safety laws, especially predator-friendly statutes of limitations that enable clerics who commit and conceal child sex crimes to stay hidden.\n\nFor the sake of public safety, Francis should order bishops to post on their websites the names of proven, admitted and credibly accused child-molesting clerics, along with their photos, whereabouts and work histories. (Under pressure, about 30 U.S. bishops have done this.)\n\nFrancis should demand that bishops turn over records about all accused child-molesting clerics to law enforcement. And he should do so with documents kept in the Vatican.\n\nIn short, I want Pope Francis to talk less and start doing, focusing on tangible, proven actions that protect kids by exposing predators and punishing enablers. Pope Francis, while he is in the United States, should tell survivors of priest sex abuse, their families and the entire Church what actions he plans to do now as the leader of the Catholic Church to right these wrongs. We deserve to know.\n\nNot looking us in the eyes as American Catholics next week and dealing with priest abuse and the cover-ups by bishops that is still going on today remains a major failing and weakness in an otherwise strong pope.", "Buy Photo Father Joseph Faraone greets worshipers before Mass in 2006 at St. Dennis Roman Catholic Church in East Fishkill.

Bail was set at $50,000 cash. State police and the Putnam County District Attorney's office declined to release any details about the case, citing its sensitive nature.\n\nAccording to the charges filed, officials are accusing Faraone of engaging in oral or anal sexual conduct with someone younger than 15 years old or with someone incapable of consent due to a mental disability or incapacity.\n\nThe charges do not appear to be associated to his time in the priesthood.\n\nFaraone was last the associate pastor at Church of St. Denis in Hopewell Junction between 2004 and 2006 and has since left the priesthood. Before that, he spent 12 years at St. James the Apostle Church in Carmel, 11 years at Church of St. Patrick in Yorktown and nine years at St. Francis of Assisi in Mount Kisco.\n\nIn 1985, while a priest at St. Patrick's, Faraone gained much publicity after winning $1.17 million in the New York Lotto. He told reporters then he had started buying twice-weekly lottery tickets two years earlier when the parish was struggling to pay for its new, $2 million church. At the time, he pledged to use half of his winnings to pay for the church and the other half to go to family, friends and other charities.\n\nBuy Photo Police Beat logo (Photo: Chris Brown/The Journal News)\n\nIt was unclear Saturday whether Faraone had retained a lawyer.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1F8H9ux", "A government that fails to secure its borders is guilty of dereliction of duty.

Veterans suicide is out-of-control and military readiness is dangerously low, yet Obama is so obsessed with pandering to liberal interest groups he\u2019s nominated an openly gay civilian to run the Army.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke.

Jindal said it wasn't a candidate's \"role\" to correct a questioner -- but also said he would have pointed out the U.S.'s anti-discrimination values.\n\nBut Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush emphatically said they believe Obama was born in the U.S. and criticized Trump for not standing up to the questioner.", "In 1998, David Mamet, the acclaimed playwright, published a short treatise, \u201cThree Uses of the Knife,\u201d on \u201cthe nature and purpose of drama.\u201d The book, based on lectures he delivered the previous year at Columbia University, is well regarded in the theatre world and among screenwriters for its philosophical approach to explaining what makes good drama. But Mamet\u2019s book also offers some shrewd observations on politics and serves as a useful tool for understanding the rise, and potential fall, of Donald Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, during the Republican Presidential debate on CNN, Trump was exposed as ignorant of basic policy details (he was a bystander during the foreign-policy exchanges), boorish (he refused to apologize to Columba Bush for saying that her background influenced Jeb\u2019s allegedly permissive views on undocumented immigrants), and he seemed\u2014no other way to put it\u2014\u201clow energy\u201d as the debate dragged on into its third hour. (As my colleague Amy Davidson put it, \u201che seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake.\u201d) Political observers then spent the day after the debate ruminating on whether we may be witnessing the beginning of Trump\u2019s decline, and whether his fate will look similar to that of the five Republican candidates\u2014Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum\u2014who all experienced similar polling surges in the 2012 G.O.P. Presidential contest, before Republican voters wised up and picked Mitt Romney.\n\nWhy did Trump\u2019s support shoot up to an average of almost thirty-five per cent in national polls? The (boring) political-science answer is that Trump\u2019s support was a function of his news coverage. His rise correlates perfectly with the amount of attention he received from the media. When voters, most of whom don\u2019t pay close attention to politics, are asked to choose from a long list of names, a third mention the one that they\u2019ve heard in the news most recently or most frequently.\n\nBut that explanation seems to leave a lot out. Why does the media cover Trump so much? Are voters, especially \u201cthe likely voters\u201d who are often polled, really that passive and ignorant? Why did they express increasingly positive views of him, as measured by favorability ratings, as the summer of Trump rolled on? How did Trump seize our attention?\n\nHe did it by stepping onto the summer stage in a way that none of his rivals did. The other Republican candidates spent 2015 attending to the traditional business of the so-called invisible primary: hiring staff, studying up on policy, building political networks in Iowa and New Hampshire, wooing elected officials whose endorsements might make a difference, and\u2014most of all\u2014courting donors.\n\nMost of the invisible primary is, well, invisible. Getting inside the rooms in New York and Miami and Dallas and Washington where the transactions of the invisible primary take place is nearly impossible. Sometimes good stories drip out, but they make for terrible TV. Meanwhile, much of the public portion of the invisible primary bores the media. Generally, the policy speeches and town-hall events in the early stages of the campaign are vague and uninteresting, as candidates resist taking firm and detailed positions on controversial topics for fear of opening themselves up to attacks later on.\n\nBut the political press demands drama. If it is not given a plot, it will create one. As Mamet argues, this is hardly unique to reporters. Humans are hardwired to turn mundane experiences into dramatic ones. \u201cIt is in our nature to dramatize,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe dramatize the weather, the traffic, and other impersonal phenomena by employing exaggeration, ironic juxtaposition, inversion, projection, all the tools the dramatist uses to create, and the psychoanalyst uses to interpret, emotionally significant phenomena.\u201d\n\nA political campaign that is organized around a drama has an immediate advantage over one that is not. Mamet argues, and he\u2019s right, that politics \u201csticks closer to traditional drama than does The Stage itself. A problem is stated, the play begins, the hero (candidate) offers herself as the protagonist who will find the solution, and the audience gives its attention.\u201d\n\nWhich of the candidates has done that this year? Trump\u2014and, to some extent, Bernie Sanders\u2014has provided a plot and fared well. Trump has identified a clear problem to which many Republican voters respond: America doesn\u2019t \u201cwin anymore.\u201d And he has offered a simple solution that only he can provide: Trump \u201cwill make America great again.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the problem and solution are laughably vague is a virtue. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has been forgettable exactly because she has insisted on promoting a myriad of highly specific solutions to very concrete problems before she has laid out the one big problem she wants to solve. (In fact, it\u2019s not so different from how Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign of \u201chope and change\u201d crushed Clinton\u2019s campaign of policy white papers.) Mamet argues that a politician \u201cwho promises drama and then delivers only social concern\u201d rarely excites the public. That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u201cessential to the healthy political campaign that the issues be largely or perhaps totally symbolic\u2014i.e. non-quantifiable.\u201d He recites a long list of slogans from recent American history, to which Trump\u2019s could easily be added: \u201cPeace with Honor, Communists in the State Department, Supply Side Economics, Recapture the Dream, Bring Back the Pride.\u201d The less detail, he argues, the more engaged the audience will be: \u201cA loose abstraction allows audience members to project their own desires onto an essentially featureless goal.\u201d\n\nTrump realized all of this, and he has had a great first act. But Wednesday night\u2019s debate suggested that he has no plan for a second act. First acts are famously easy to pull off. \u201cIt has often been remarked that anyone can write a good first act,\u201d Mamet notes. \u201cWhen the curtain goes up, we\u2019ve got your attention. So we dramatists don\u2019t have to do anything for a while. Later, either the plot will kick in or the audience will start yawning and eating popcorn.\u201d\n\nThe struggle of the second act in a political campaign, as in any drama, is that the problem identified at the beginning\u2014the one that seized our attention\u2014must be translated into the more mundane tasks that propel the protagonist toward his or her goal. Won\u2019t even the most committed Trump supporter start to wonder why this self-proclaimed savior hasn\u2019t prepared himself to answer standard policy questions? Will Trump build a staff and campaign infrastructure in Iowa and New Hampshire to handle all the dull mechanics of finding voters and getting them to the polls? Again, Obama\u2019s historic 2008 campaign is a good point of comparison: the vague promise of \u201chope and change\u201d was married to an enormously sophisticated national operation that tended to the mechanics of winning the delegates needed to capture his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nMamet illustrates second-act problems\u2014and their solutions\u2014by pointing to the real-life examples of political actors who actually changed history. The most ambitious and inspirational leaders are also the ones who, after articulating what seemed to be an impossibly lofty goal, soon found themselves mired in the tedious work required to realize it. \u201cIn the middle term the high-minded goal has devolved into what seem to be quotidian, mechanical, and ordinary drudgery,\u201d Mamet writes. Trump seems more ill-prepared to bother with the ordinary drudgery of politics than anyone in the race.\n\nPerhaps Trump can keep the first act going a little longer, but it is far more likely\u2014and the debate made it seem obvious\u2014that he hasn\u2019t a clue how to move beyond the bluster and bromides that initially seized our attention. The curtain may come down soon.", "At Wednesday night's debate, GOP front-runner Donald Trump once again repeated the totally discredited\u2014and incredibly dangerous\u2014theory that vaccines cause autism. You can watch it above. Basically, everything Trump said about vaccines was wrong. A lot of what his opponents said was wrong, too.\n\nWhat's more, this barrage of misinformation appears to have caused a massive increase in Google searches about the supposed vaccine-autism connection. The spike on the Google Trends chart below occurred shortly after the exchange:\n\n\"Autism has become an epidemic,\" Trump claimed. \"Twenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close. It has gotten totally out of control.\" Scientists dispute this: While it's true that autism diagnoses have risen, a recent study suggested that the number of children with autism symptoms has remained stable. In other words, autism may not be getting more common; we're just diagnosing it more often.\n\n\"I am totally in favor of vaccines,\" Trump insisted, before adding, \"but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time\u2026I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two- or three-year period of time. Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump\u2014I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child, and we've had so many instances, people that work for me. Just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\" By spreading out the vaccine schedule, Trump concluded, \"I think you're going to see a big impact on autism.\"\n\nVaccines do not cause autism. Spreading out vaccines over a longer time period won't make anyone safer, but it will put more children at risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, as my colleague Kiera Butler has explained. And those diseases can be deadly. \"When you delay vaccines, you increase the period of time in which you are susceptible to those diseases,\" vaccine expert Paul Offit told the New York Times Thursday. \"We are seeing the effects of that. The outbreak we saw this year in Southern California was among parents who had chosen to delay or withheld vaccines for their children.\"\n\nTwo of Trump's Republican rivals are doctors, but unfortunately they didn't clear up the issue.\n\n\"We have extremely well-documented proof that there's no autism associated with vaccinations,\" explained Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon. But, he added, \"it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.\"\n\nNo, it's not true.\n\n\"I'm all for vaccines, but I'm also for freedom,\" said Rand Paul, a former ophthalmologist. \"I'm also a little concerned about how they're bunched up. My kids had all of their vaccines, and even if the science doesn't say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to have the right to spread my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.\" Paul, who has previously suggested that vaccines can cause \"profound mental disorders,\" has been an outspoken opponent of proposals to strengthen vaccination mandates.\n\nFor his part, moderator Jake Tapper noted that \"the medical community adamantly disputes\" Trump's ideas about vaccines. But it's fair to assume that many people confused by this exchange immediately turned to the internet for more information. Fortunately, Google's top search results debunk Trump's theories, but you don't have to dig very far to find a number of websites promoting the vaccine-autism myth. After all, notorious vaccine critic Jenny McCarthy once explained that she began learning about autism at the \"University of Google.\"", "Justice Donald Trump Has A New Gun Plan, And It\u2019s Just As Crazy As You Think CREDIT: AP Photo/Mike Groll Donald Trump speaks during a gun rights rally at the Empire State Plaza on Tuesday, April 1, 2014, in Albany, N.Y.\n\nDonald Trump imagines a world where regular citizens can buy automatic weapons; where gun owners can hide their weapons in any state; where there are no expanded background checks for gun purchases; and where citizens fight crime with their own assault rifles.\n\nThat\u2019s at least according to Trump\u2019s position statement on guns, which he released on Friday. In it, the Republican presidential candidate laid out a vision on the Second Amendment similar to the one held by the National Rifle Association, which opposes new gun control measures and advocates instead for stricter enforcement of existing laws.\n\n\u201cThe Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThe right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.\u201d\n\nA few parts of Trump\u2019s statement focus on concealed carry, or the right for gun owners to walk around in public with their weapons hidden. He advocated for a federal law that mimicks a driver\u2019s license \u2014 in other words, if you get a concealed carry permit in one state, it should be enforceable in other states. Currently, there is no federal law addressing this \u2014 though all 50 states allow concealed carry with some type of permit, each permit has different terms, and is only enforceable in the state in which it was given.\n\nThis position is particularly personal to Trump. \u201cOur personal protection is ultimately up to us,\u201d his statement reads. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m a gun owner, that\u2019s why I have a concealed carry permit, and that\u2019s why tens of millions of Americans have concealed carry permits as well.\u201d\n\nPersonal protection was another theme of Trump\u2019s plan, which advocated \u201cempowering\u201d citizens to defend themselves and fight crime with their own weapons. \u201cHere\u2019s another important way to fight crime \u2014 empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves,\u201d his plan reads. \u201cLaw enforcement is great, they do a tremendous job, but they can\u2019t be everywhere all of the time.\u201d\n\nNot only does Trump want citizens to fight crime, but he wants them to have better, more powerful guns to do it.\n\n\u201cGun and magazine bans are a total failure,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOpponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like \u2018assault weapons,\u2019 \u2018military-style weapons\u2019 and \u2018high capacity magazines\u2019 to confuse people. What they\u2019re really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaw-abiding people should be allowed to own the firearm of their choice,\u201d he added. \u201cThe government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t totally new ground for Trump, who has been pro-gun for a long time. But he wasn\u2019t always against some of these restrictions. In 2000, Trump criticized Republicans for \u201cwalk[ing] the NRA line and refus[ing] even limited restrictions\u201d on guns. In the same year, he also said he supported banning assault weapons and expanding background checks. \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWith today\u2019s Internet technology we should be able to tell within 72-hours if a potential gun owner has a record.\u201d\n\nHis previous positions can be seen in Trump\u2019s own business dealings. A ThinkProgress investigation in August revealed that, despite Trump\u2019s current advocacy for gun-free zones, a number of Trump\u2019s hotels and golf courses are gun-free zones \u2014 even for guests with concealed-carry permits.\n\nInstead of placing restrictions on firearms or endorsement more stringent background checks, Trump\u2019s new plan focuses on expanding access to mental health care \u2014 though it does lack specifics on how much funds should be allocated, and what type of treatment programs should be focused on. Instead, it just says this: \u201cWe need to expand treatment programs, because most people with mental health problems aren\u2019t violent, they just need help.\u201d", "Yesterday Donald Trump held a fundraiser for a veterans group on the deck of the USS Iowa in California. Last night Rachel Maddow revealed that the \u201cgroup\u201d is actually just one guy in South Dakota and that it has $30 in the bank. Raw Story recaps:\n\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow exposed the \u201cveterans group\u201d using an appearance by Donald Trump as a fundraiser on Tuesday as an apparent one-man organization. Trump\u2019s appearance aboard the USS Iowa, she explained, was an event benefiting Veterans for a Strong America, with tickets ranging between $100 and $1,000. However, Maddow said, the Federal Election Commission filings for the group\u2019s PAC reveal that, besides having only $30 cash in hand and $318 in debts, the organization\u2019s only member is founder Joel Arends. \u201cDonald Trump was not in the military, but he did use a pretty military backdrop tonight to raise money for a non-existent veterans\u2019 group, which endorsed him formally as part of his introduction \u2014 and he said they have hundreds of thousands of members,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t. And so the whole thing is fake.\u201d\n\nTrump has yet to acknowledge the scandal.\n\n", "Sen.

A second prominent player in the Romney campaign \u2014 Digital Director Zac Moffat \u2014 has not fully disclosed what, if any, ongoing business relationship he maintains with Targeted Victory LLC. Press reports have referred to Moffat as the co-founder of Targeted Victory LLC.\u201d\n\nLater in the piece, Leahy detailed that Beeson was personally the creator of Project ORCA.\n\n\u201cConnections between FLS Connect LLC and the Romney campaign are equally strong. Rich Beeson, who was named Romney\u2019s Political Director in 2011, worked as an FLS Connect LLC partner prior to that time,\u201d Leahy wrote. \u201cThe failed election day software program ORCA was Beeson\u2019s idea.\u201d\n\nUPDATE:\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign remains silent on the allegations, which Breitbart News has confirmed were forwarded to a prosecutor for review.\n\n\u201cWe are handling it. A complaint was filed. It has been forwarded to the Mackinac County prosecutor for review. We are not currently seeking Mr. Beeson,\u201d Mackinac Island Police Chief Brett Riccinto tells Breitbart News.\n\nContrary to original reports, Michigan State Police are not involved in the investigation into the Rubio aide\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThe Mich State Police are not involved. The Mackinac Island Police Dept is investigating [the incident of Rubio CM allegedly punching Paul campaign adviser in face],\u201d a spokesperson for the Michigan State Police tells Breitbart News.\n\nIn addition, Rubio\u2019s campaign manager Terry Sullivan apologized to Yob\u2014but not publicly\u2014for Beeson\u2019s violence, according to emails Politico obtained.\n\n\u201cAccording to the email exchange, Sullivan at first believed Yob was joking but then apologizes when he realizes Yob is serious,\u201d Politico wrote of the emails without publishing them.\n\n\u201cIt is understandable that he would have initially thought that this was too crazy to actually be true,\u201d Yob told Politico about Sullivan\u2019s reaction. \u201cThe Rubio campaign is not to blame.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "During the Republican debate Wednesday night, one of Jeb Bush\u2019s only applause lines came from countering an attack from Donald Trump on the presidency of George W.

This Pope has done more to take on the establishment he leads than any other Vatican leader in our lifetime. And he has done so with grace, energy, and determination. Our political leaders will all be there watching him. They should learn from him too.\n\nWhen I served in the heart of a Catholic village in Costa Rica as an environmental education Peace Corps Volunteer in the 1990's, I was new to the power of the Pope. At that time, Pope John Paul II was in the Vatican, and he set an example for the people I lived with and grew to love. They looked to him for guidance and were infused with energy from their Catholic faith.\n\nEvery morning I would hear the chants of the priests over the radio reciting morning prayers. I saw how the spirit of the village was infused with energy from their Catholic faith. It reminded me of my Jewish upbringing and the vitality that being Jewish has given me. It created a sense of community and shared values in the village, values that were inclusive and inspiring.\n\nThese values that guided my village friends were in many ways a product of the community's faith. They believed in supporting each other, in knowing their neighbors, in ensuring that everyone around them was cared for. They knew the earth around them as well, understanding how the mountains, streams, and wildlife both sustained and enriched their world.\n\nThat experience, where community values generated by faith in something bigger than oneself ruled the day, is what is creating such a buzz about the new Pope Francis. He exudes a devotion to the community and the natural world around us, and does so in a manner that is attractive to all of us. I see in him much of what I saw in that Central American village - a true desire to make the world a better place.\n\nWhich brings us back to the current crop of American politicians that the Pope will soon be addressing. The Pope strikingly stands for solutions that our Congressional leaders - and us by extension - would benefit from embracing.\n\nThink climate change. Think women's rights. Think economic equality. Think social tolerance. Think immigration. Think Iran and Middle East peace.\n\n\"Climate change is a global problem with grave implications...\" and that \"... there is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy.\"\n\n\"... Equal compensation for equal work,\" proclaiming \"... Why is it expected that women must earn less than men? No! They have the same rights. The disparity is a pure scandal.\"\n\n\"Working for a just distribution of the fruits of the earth and human labor is not mere philanthropy. It is a moral obligation. For Christians, the responsibility is even greater: it is a commandment.\"\n\n\"A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: 'Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?' We must always consider the person. Here we enter into the mystery of the human being.\"\n\n\"A change of attitude towards migrants and refugees is needed on the part of everyone, moving away from attitudes of defensiveness and fear, indifference and marginalization - all typical of a throwaway culture - towards attitudes based on a culture of encounter, the only culture capable of building a better, more just and fraternal world.\"\n\n\"May one cry rise up from every land, 'No' to war and violence and 'Yes' to dialogue and to peace. With war one always loses. The only way to win a war is never to wage it.\" \"The Holy See values positively this (Iran nuclear) agreement because it considers that the way to resolve disputes and difficulties should always be that of dialogue and negotiation... The full implementation of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) will ensure the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme under the NPT and will be a definitive step toward greater stability and security in the region.\"\n\nThe Pope understands that:Our Congress should recognize this and follow this lead. He has also loudly proclaimed that women's rights and equality must be demanded, such as when he calls for:And on economic equality, he is clear:The same goes for his belief in social tolerance for the LGBT community. For example, he once said:And on immigration he is clear:Likewise, on issues of war and peace, such as Iran and the Middle East, he has no reservations:\n\nOn all of these issues, the Pope stands for progress. These are values that not only he, but also the majority of Americans, believe in. But will our own Congress show enthusiasm for these views? Will they stand and applaud the community values that the Pope represents and calls for, or will they sit on their hands? Their actions will represent all of us to the world, and I pray that they do the right thing.\n\nBut I'm not holding my breath.\n\nMy guess is that the majority of the audience members will behave as they currently do when these issues are brought up: they will oppose them. My Costa Rican village friends will likely be watching the speech, and I'm sure that they will be saddened at such a response. And if this is what happens, we should make our voices heard, and demand that Congress truly listen to what the Pope has to say.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Since acquiring South Carolina-based SWR (Southeastern Weaponry Research) Manufacturing in 2011, SilencerCo has become the largest maker of silencers in the U.S.It has been toying around with silencers for years, just waiting for an innovative idea that would put it on top. It has apparently found that product in the Maxim 9. The company's prototype is built partially on a Smith & Wesson M&P body, but Josh Waldron, SilencerCo\u2019s CEO, told Range365 that the guns coming out in 2016 will be designed and built completely by SilencerCo.Waldron added, \u201cTo make room for the suppressor we had to re-engineer everything. We are just working out the final details, which is why this won\u2019t be available until 2016.\u201d The company hopes to have the Maxim 9 out in time for the January 2016 Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade Show (SHOT Show).Even though Waldron didn't give out too many details about the unusual weapon, he did say, \"The Maxim 9 is a duty pistol, short, quiet, reliable, durable and can use any [9 mm] ammo.\" Supposedly, that's all a shooting enthusiast need to know.The Maxim 9 is not the first gun to be made with a built-in silencer. The High Standard HDM is a semiautomatic pistol equipped with an integral sound suppressor and was used during WWII by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Sturm, Ruger (RGR) currently produces them.Waldron points out that the maxim 9 is a much more powerful handgun than the .22-caliber silencer-handguns made by Sturm, Ruger, and he says this makes the Maxim 9 better suited for \"personal protection.\"There is a market for gun silencers today, and as a matter of fact, sales are booming. Despite tight gun-control restrictions, gun owners are willing to pay from $350 to $2,500 for silencers on the market. CNN Money is reporting the ATF's latest figures show the number of registered silencers jumped 38 percent year-over-year to 792,282 in February 2015.When the Maxim 9 goes on sale next year, it will be subject to the same federal laws that apply to silencers, or more accurately, suppressors. The noise is suppressed, but not altogether silenced. Suppressors are more vigorously regulated than most guns.Generally, a background check takes about 20 minutes. A photo ID is electronically submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by the gun shop, and if everything comes back OK, you're out of there. But buying a suppressor or any gun that falls under the National Firearms Act including full automatic machine guns and sawed-off shotguns is another matter.The buyer has to mail or fax a photo and fingerprints to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and pay a $200 tax. The wait for an answer can sometimes take as long as nine months, say WTVR.com. Suppressors are also subject to state law, and a few states have outlawed them. Suppressors are legal in 41 states, up from 37 a few years ago.", "During the Republican debate Wednesday night, one of Jeb Bush\u2019s only applause lines came from countering an attack from Donald Trump on the presidency of George W.

The article revealed that 50 intelligence analysts had formally complained that their reports about IS and al Nusra, an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group, were being altered by senior officials to downplay the groups\u2019 strength.\n\nHayes said that intelligence has been hidden and massaged by the Obama administration to downplay the strength of al Qaeda for years.\n\n\u201cMy argument is that this isn\u2019t a new scandal at all,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThere were games played with [the Osama bin Laden documents].

Scott Walker boasted that he \u201ctook on union bosses from Washington\u201d in his 2011 effort to crush state public-employee union rights.\n\nBut according to a stunning, detailed new statement by a former top Republican legislative aide, it turns out that Walker isolated himself and hid in tightly controlled, heavily-guarded environments during the conflict covering six intense weeks in early 2011\u2014which directly contradicts his tall tale of courageously facing his adversaries.\n\n\u201cOur unintimidated governor continued to only participate in private events with the media excluded or tightly controlled,\u201d wrote Michael Boerger, former top aide to retired Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis, in a September 10 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion piece.\n\nUnintimidated is the title of Walker\u2019s fact-challenged biography that recounts fiercely battling tens of thousands of pro-labor advocates as he pushed Act 10 into law. The legislation stripped most Wisconsin employees of any practical rights to union representation.\n\nWalker\u2019s reliance on his oft-told tale of political courage did not help deliver a breakout performance to counter his slipping poll numbers at Wednesday\u2019s debate. But Boerger\u2019s astonishing account of a man who hid from his critics and the public\u2014but later boasted of facing down enemies\u2014could mark a turning point for his 2016 ambitions.\n\nAs Boerger noted in his recent Milwaukee Journal Sentinel op-ed, while Walker sat quivering in fear, Madison police reported virtually no violence despite crowds of up to 150,000 protesters who stayed peaceful throughout the protracted battle over the legislation.\n\nWalker is a promoting a national anti-labor agenda as a cornerstone of his presidential campaign. In March, he signed a \u201cright-to-work\u201d bill for Wisconsin despite repeated assurances to the public and in private to conservative labor leaders that such a bill would never reach his desk. More recently, he has called for federal right-to-work laws, which discourage union membership and suppress wages, banning federal employee unions and closing the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nEven those who know Walker best are not impressed with his latest anti-union plans. Milwaukee\u2019s Journal Sentinel, a conservative paper which endorsed Walker three times for governor, dismissed his call for \u201cAct 10 nationwide\u201d and basically called him a serial liar.\n\n\u201cIt is more politicking from a governor who as recently as last year when running for re-election called right-to-work a distraction, then proceeded to sign the legislation anyway when it passed the Legislature,\u201d it editorialized. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growing distrust of Walker are Boerger\u2019s revelations that reveal Walker was hardly \u201cunintimidated\u201d in confronting unions. Last winter, candidate Walker ridiculously said that his battle with unionists showed that he could stand up to ISIS terrorists.\n\nWalker has also repeatedly said that he showed leadership by pushing Republican legislative leaders to fully support Act 10, which Boerger resented. His op-ed opened, \u201cAs a front-row witness to the sad history of the passage of Act 10, I have to refute the notion currently being advanced by Gov. Scott Walker that he faced stiff opposition to his proposal from GOP legislative leaders.\u201d\n\nBoerger\u2019s comments reflect the bitterness of Republicans who feel that they took the brunt of criticism from voters and were forced to engage in extraordinary anti-democratic tactics to prevent a high-profile loss for the new governor under an international spotlight\u2014as the Madison rebellion coincided with a popular uprising in Egypt and captured international headlines and TV coverage. Despite the GOP legislators\u2019 willingness to bend the rules to pass Act 10 for Walker, they saw themselves as unappreciated by the governor.\n\n\u201cEvery day that spring, legislators had to run a gantlet of protesters and meet in public in the Capitol for committee meetings and legislative sessions,\u201d stated Boerger. \u201cMeanwhile, our unintimidated governor was making speeches in minutely controlled, private venues that often even excluded attendance by the media.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Walker was so petrified of any direct challenge that he initially planned to deliver his high-profile budget address away from the State Capitol in a more tightly-guarded site, Boerger said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, the governor even planned to give his budget address outside the Capitol in such a private, security-dominated venue. Unintimidated? It was GOP leaders who convinced the governor to appear in public, in the statehouse as every other governor has done.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first account that has revealed Walker\u2019s self-described profile in courage as a big lie. While Republican legislators often faced protesters in heated dialogue as they circulated around the Capitol, Walker remained cloistered in his heavily-guarded office and \u201cslunk to and from the state Capitol via underground tunnels\u201d with armed escorts, Guardian journalist Jeb Lund reported.\n\nAs Walker\u2019s presidential ambitions keep floundering, it is beginning to appear that he is fated to return his bunker at the Capitol\u2014where he hid when he first launched his attack on labor and nurtured his presidential ambitions. But this time, he would be hiding from everyone who he used to fan his presidential ambitions.", "", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

[Fox News, Outnumbered, 9/17/15; Media Matters, 9/17/15]\n\nFox's Gallagher: Ahmed Wasn't \"Forthcoming\" Enough With Police. On the September 18 edition of Fox News' The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson, Fox contributor Mike Gallagher repeatedly compared Ahmed's homemade clock to a bomb, and suggested that the student should have been more \"forthcoming\" when he was interrogated by the police:\n\nMIKE GALLAGHER: The ABC affiliate in Dallas reports that the kid wasn't particularly forthcoming when the police were called. Let me give him a word of advice. When he goes to the White House for his clock-building summit with President Obama, he might want to leave that contraption behind because the U.S. Secret Service would have big problems with it. Did you see it? The thing doesn't look like a clock. [...] GALLAGHER: We're told: see something, say something. Now, I guess if you see something-- ALAN COLMES: A clock? GALLAGHER: That looks like a clock? COLMES: A clock? A 14 year-old with a clock? GALLAGHER: Yeah, put that clock around your wrist, okay. Put it side by side by a real suitcase bomb, and it's hard to tell the difference. [Fox News, The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson, 9/18/15]\n\nLimbaugh: Obama Is Using This To \"Characterize The United States As A Racist And Bigoted Country.\" On the September 17 edition of The Rush Limbaugh Show, Limbaugh attacked President Obama for supposedly using Ahmed's experience to make his own \"star shine a little bit brighter,\" and blamed Ahmed and \"zero-tolerance\" school policies for fueling the arrest:\n\nRUSH: So the point here is that the effort is being made to blame school officials and the cops for Islamophobia here, and that is not what is going on. Zero-tolerance policies at schools, which are the direct result of previous incidents -- the zero tolerance is out of control, such as pretending to shoot a gun with your finger (that gets you sent home) -- is what's responsible here. It's just the latest example, and it's made to order for Obama, because here we have once again backlash against Muslims, you see? That's what this really is. So Obama will be able to make a speech about how dangerous this is, how unfortunate it is, how sorry it is. Innocent little 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has a brilliant science project, a brilliant clock, a new way of doing a clock. (Yeah, one looks just like a bomb in a briefcase.) Obama gets to bring him to the White House, make a star out of him, make Obama's star shine even brighter. And once again, the bottom line: Characterize the United States as a racist and bigoted country. [Premiere Radio Networks,The Rush Limbaugh Show, 9/17/15]\n\nNational Review Online: \"A Phony Case Of Islamophobia.\" National Review Online correspondent Kevin D. Williamson declared Ahmed's controversial arrest to be \"a phony case of Islamophobia,\" and attacked President Obama and other public figures for expressing support for Ahmed, calling their actions \"cheap moral preening,\" and arguing that the story only received attention because it \"can be used to further a story\" about racism in the United States:\n\nThe story immediately became ubiquitous not because of what actually happened -- boneheaded as that was -- but because it can be used to further a story that the media already want to tell: that the United States is morally corrupt and irredeemably racist; that Muslims are under siege; that \"white privilege\" blinds the majority of Americans to the corruption at the heart of everything red, white, and blue. Muslim kid meets paranoia in Texas is A-1 copy; NRA-wearing kid meets paranoia in West Virginia, not so much. President Barack Obama, never one to miss an opportunity for cheap moral preening, invited Mohamed to the White House. [National Review Online, 9/17/15]\n\nBreitbart Editor: \"Race Grifters Unite.\" Breitbart.com Editor-At-Large John Nolte argued that the public attention given to the role of race in Ahmed's case was the work of \"shameless opportunists,\" and compared Ahmed's experience to examples of \"hysterical Zero Tolerance school policies,\" such as a student suspended for violating school dress code, praying, and saying \"God bless you\":\n\nNaturally, these shameless opportunists expressed zero outrage when a fifth-grader, a full four years younger than Ahmed, was arrested and charged with brandishing a weapon for bringing a toy gun on a school bus. Why would they? There's no political upside for the Left unless you can scream racism. Then there was the 7 year-old boy suspended for a Pop Tart Gun. Once again: No political upside, no media uproar, no White House invite. Then there was the 5th grade girl who was searched by school officials for possessing a paper gun. No political upside means no media uproar and no White House invite. [Breitbart.com, 9/16/15]\n\nThe Federalist Editor: #IStandWithAhmed Is About \"Pretend Islamaphobia.\" Senior editor of The Federalist, David Harsanyi, argued that public support for Ahmed was \"selective concern trolling\" to create the perception that discrimination against Muslims is a pervasive problem in American life:\n\nSo a story that perfectly illustrated the tendencies of overbearing school administrators is now transformed into a teachable moment about \"Islamophobia.\" And blowing up a nonevent is a way to create the perception that discrimination against Muslims is a pervasive problem in American life. In the real world, though, the preponderance of victims of jumpy teachers are not Muslims. But those cases do not provide Vox or the White House with the fodder they need for some self-satisfying lecturing. [The Federalist, 9/17/15]\n\nTownhall Columnist: Ahmed \"Created An Environment That Required The Teachers To Act.\" Townhall columnist Jim Hanson claimed the school was being unfairly \"slurred as Islamophobic\" and placed the blame on the 14-year-old Ahmed for \"bring[ing] something to school that causes questions to be asked,\" and on \"nanny state, zero tolerance policies.\" Hanson compared Ahmed's clock to pictures of an Iranian-made improvised explosive device (IED) trigger, calling it a \"dead ringer\" for triggers used on homemade bombs the author saw in Iraq:\n\nThe latest outrage being used to promote the false narrative about unfair treatment of Muslims is the teenager, Ahmed Mohamed, in Irving Texas arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school. If you just skimmed the surface and saw the picture of the skinny nerd in the NASA t-shirt in handcuffs it would be easy to see a problem. And there is one, but it's not discrimination against a Muslim kid that wouldn't have happened to a non-Muslim. It's nanny state, zero tolerance policies that take away the ability to apply common sense to complicated situations. In this case, whether or not to put cuffs on a 14 year old when he brings something to school that causes questions to be asked. But as far as the other question, was the clock device he brought to school a legitimate cause for concern, the answer is an unequivocal yes. I have built and taught classes on improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and the clock he brought to school is a dead ringer for the trigger used on many of these homemade bombs. [Townhall.com, 9/17/15]\n\nBreitbart Contributor: Arrest Happened \"Because Of Zero Tolerance Policies, Not Islamophobia.\" Breitbart contributor Merrill Hope argued that the blame for Ahmed's treatment rested with the Irving Schools Code of Conduct, and lamented the \"Islamophobic narrative\" she claimed was perpetuated by President Obama and Hillary Clinton's public support for Ahmed:\n\nOnce the predominantly Islamophobic slanted story broke nationally, outpourings of support for Mohamed exploded on social media. In response, Ahmed Mohamed milked the PR spin. He tweeted: \"Thank you for your support! I really didn't think people would care about a muslim boy. #Thankyouforstandingwithme. #IStandWithAhmed. Not long after, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted out her two cents on social media on the Islamophobic narrative. Not to be outdone, President Barrack Obama also jumped on the bandwagon and invited young Mohamed to the White House. [Breitbart.com, 9/16/15]\n\nInfowars: Notion That Mohamed Was Treated Differently Because Of Race Is \"Completely Bogus.\" At Infowars, Editor-At Large Paul Joseph Watson claimed that Ahmed's story gained attention because of the \"trendy\" fact that the student is Muslim and called the notion that Ahmed's race or religion played a factor in his treatment \"completely bogus\":\n\n14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed built a clock to impress his teacher but ended up in handcuffs after police were called over concerns the object resembled a bomb. The leftist media and social justice warrior 'virtue signallers' immediately leapt on the story to claim that Mohamed was targeted because he was a Muslim (and not because his \"clock\" looked nothing like a clock and more closely resembled a bomb in a briefcase). [...] Never wasting an opportunity to ingratiate himself with the politically correct crowd, Obama reached out to Ahmed and invited him to visit the White House. The notion that white kids wouldn't be treated the same way and that Ahmed was only targeted because of his skin color or religion is completely bogus. Innumerable non-Muslim kids have been disciplined, suspended and even SWAT-teamed for objects far less concerning than Ahmed's clock. [...] To the left, defending American kids who are persecuted for wearing Old Glory just isn't trendy enough, but if a Muslim called Mohamed gets in trouble for bringing something that resembles a bomb to school, liberals are falling over themselves to worship him. [InfoWars.com, 9/17/15]\n\nBreitbart's Ben Shapiro: Ahmed's Experience \"Stinks with Leftist Exploitation.\" Breitbart's Senior Editor-At-Large Ben Shapiro pushed a theory that Ahmed's father, who he called \"an anti-Islamaphobia media gadfly,\" exploited his son's experience to push a message of widespread Islamophobia:\n\nAgain, where was the engineering teacher to vouch for Mohammed's story? Why didn't Mohammed simply explain himself? The police said that initially, it was \"not immediately evident\" that the clock-in-a-case was a class experiment - perfectly plausible, given that Mohammed built the clock-in-a-case voluntarily, without assignment, and in conjunction with no science fair.

I stayed up all night transfixed, watching the real life video game spectacle of the first Gulf War on CNN.\n\nAfter listening to Rush Limbaugh during the week, and then watching C-SPAN on Sundays, I would put on my best suit and pretend to be the first black president of the United States; naturally I was a Lincoln/Reagan Republican. I then delivered speeches about American freedom, democracy, justice, and opportunity while I looked in the mirror on my bedroom wall. The preferred scenario was my leading the United States into a war or offering up a version of a Roosevelt fireside chat as economic calamity threatened the country (usually caused by the devious and disciplined Japanese). Only I, the country\u2019s first black President, could unite the people in victory both foreign and domestic.\n\nAs a child of the 1980s, I grew up watching movies such as \u201cRambo,\u201d \u201cRed Dawn,\u201d and \u201cMissing in Action.\u201d I voraciously read \u201cG.I. Joe\u201d comics and military-themed magazines like Soldier of Fortune and Take Off. I played military simulations on my Amiga and Commodore 64 computers. I won World War 3 many times over. I vanquished the Russians, Libyans, and Iranians with ease in my Microsoft flight simulations and SSI turn based strategy games. I stopped the Russians and their allies at the Fulda Gap; I sunk the Warsaw Pact battle fleets in the Kola Peninsula and near Iceland. I wondered, how hard could doing the same thing be in real life?\n\nI knew the secret to beating the Russians and creating a Pax Americana that would spread freedom, democracy, and \u201cAmerican values\u201d around the world: Peace through superior firepower. America is the greatest country on Earth. The real problem is that the rest of the world has not yet been made aware of this self-evident fact.\n\nWednesday evening\u2019s CNN Republican debate featured childish thoughts such as these, thoughts that normally are discarded long ago by reasonable and mature adults, instead now being offered as serious policy analysis from people who want to be President of the United States.\n\nCNN\u2019s Republican debate was a spectacle. In the primaries, candidates struggle to distinguish themselves from one another by running to the extremes in order to win the approval of the most rabid elements of their party\u2019s base. Traditionally, the chosen candidate then veers back to the middle in order to win over the \u201cmedian voter\u201d and independents. These individuals are usually persuadable \u201cswing voters\u201d to one of the United States\u2019 two major parties.\n\nBut, what if the \u201cbase\u201d consists of people who live in an alternate world where facts, empirical reality, and scientific reason and truth operate according to a different set of rules? What happens to a supposedly mainstream political party\u2019s internal dynamics when the most extreme elements are given control over it? And what if these voters have been socialized into an bizarro reality by a media machine that has created a literal and virtual bubble of information for its viewers and listeners, one where the \u201cnews\u201d actually misinforms, thus leaving its public less knowledgeable about current affairs than before?\n\nThis alternate reality is the world in which the Republican Party and its candidates for president in 2016 exist. It is utterly impenetrable to outsiders. \u201cNormal\u201d politics do not exist there. This cult-like world is vexing, confusing, headache inducing, disorientating, and enraging for those in the \u201creality based community\u201d who try to process the 2016 Republican debates. Ultimately, if one is not initiated into the right-wing movement\u2019s rites and rituals, you will not be able to translate its political acts of magic and speaking in tongues that masquerade as serious political discourse.\n\nAs a political cult, today\u2019s Republican Party uses faith, a belief in that which cannot be proven by ordinary means, to create a coherent worldview for its public. In this world there are no verifiable truth-claims that can be confirmed or rejected based on empirical evidence. Here, something is \u201ctrue\u201d because a trusted source, elder, elite, or media personality tells you so. Opinion is transformed into a substitute for facts.\n\nShorter version: Lies are made into truths for those in the cult and disbelievers are cast out as enemies and heretics.\n\nLast night\u2019s Republican debate was a theater and master class in lies. Joseph Goebbels would be proud as the 2016 Republican candidates channeled his Principles of Propaganda and their directives that:\n\nPropaganda to the home front must create an optimum anxiety level.\n\nPropaganda must facilitate the displacement of aggression by specifying the targets for hatred.\n\nThe reality is this: Social security will not be bankrupt in 7 to 8 years. George Bush did not keep America \u201csafe\u201d as he presided over the worst terrorist attacks in the country\u2019s history. The Iraqi government demanded that the United States leave after years of a disastrous war\u2014Obama did not choose to \u201cabandon\u201d the country of Iraq. Global warming is a fact. And \u201cBenghazi\u201d has been investigated repeatedly. There is only malfeasance and \u201ctreason\u201d in the minds of the right-wing faithful and their media.

The facile thinking that laws are only obeyed by the \u201clawful\u201d, and therefore apparently have no use, is the fantasy those who want to live in a Hobbesian state of nature.\n\nChildish thinking, lies, and increasing rates of authoritarian belief and social dominance behavior among conservatives, are both reflected in and encouraged by the modern right-wing imagination.\n\nThe Republican 2016 candidates \u2014 with perhaps the exception of Rand Paul, at least on this one issue \u2014 seem either unable or unwilling to grasp how the chaos and confusion in the Middle East, which they bemoan and panic over as a sign of a \u201cweak\u201d America (and of course caused only by President Obama), are directly (and indirectly) the result of the policies of the Bush administration.\n\nA country and people without a past, unable to comprehend cause and effect, are living in an empire of illusion where the neoliberal nightmare, and the culture of cruelty, force them into an immediate present in which there is no historical context for understanding the forces that shape society and create a state of immiseration among the masses. The masses cannot effectively respond because they are so utterly and completely disoriented.\n\nWednesday night\u2019s Republican debate did however feature one bright, shining, moment, when Donald Trump, professional wrestling heel and reality TV star, let slip a basic truth: In response to a question about foreign policy, Trump admitted what an insightful and observant global public has always known about today\u2019s Republican Party, when he explained that he is \u201ca very militaristic person.\u201d Of course, he was not condemned, booed, or heckled by his fellow candidates, nor those in the audience at the Reagan library.\n\nIn their own way, ugly truths can be very refreshing.\n\nMike Huckabee ended Wednesday night\u2019s debate by channeling Ronald Reagan, and the Republican Party\u2019s racist Southern Strategy \u201claw and order\u201d ethos, by threatening the Black Lives Matter movement. This was the expected and boilerplate Republican politics of white racial resentment in the Age of Obama.\n\nMeanwhile, it was Carly Fiorina who embodied the evening\u2019s greatest praxis of childish politics, authoritarianism, lies, myth making, and cultish delusions. As though she were on a high school debate team, Fiorina delivered a hackneyed and tired speech to the Republican faithful about the Statue of Liberty and blind Lady Justice. In Fiorina\u2019s ahistorical world, American justice does not consistently discriminate against the poor and black people. In her utopian conception of American exceptionalism, the United States did not have immigration quotas and racist laws which for most of its history guaranteed that it would remain a majority white country, where people of color were not welcome.\n\nWednesday night\u2019s CNN debate showed the American people an alternate reality where Chuck Norris movies are the Bible for statecraft and childish speeches about the Statue of Liberty are considered respectable and serious political thought.\n\nThe 2016 Republican primary season is a human zoo. The frightening fact is that one of the survivors of this battle royal will be one of the two candidates for President of the United States next year.\n\nAdult children who dress up and give speeches as they role-play being President of the United States are competing in a real life Republican cosplay competition to be one of the most powerful people on Earth.

However, during Fiornia\u2019s six-year tenure at Hewlett-Packard between 1999 and 2005, the company sold more than $100 million worth of computers and other high-tech equipment to Iranian customers, despite US export sanctions at the time. It\u2019s a small detail she has neglected to mention while on the campaign trail.\n\nHow did HP do it? The usual corporate schemes: the products were channeled through one of HP\u2019s European subsidiaries, and sold through an IT distributor in Dubai, known as Reddington Gulf. The sales continued long after HP sacked Fiorina. By 2007, more than 40% of printers sold in Iran bore the HP trademark.\n\nHP had started skirting Iran sanctions in 1997, two years before Fiorina came on board. By that time, sanctions imposed by the Clinton Administration had been in place for two years. However, there was a loophole in the law that allowed HP to do business in Iran \u201clegally,\u201d albeit indirectly. Under the rules in place at the time, foreign subsidiaries of American companies were considered outside of US jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the issue came to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2009 because of concerns that the equipment might be used for military or terrorism-related purposes. HP\u2019s legal department claimed that, because the subsidiaries were not \u201cUnited States [corporate] person(s),\u201d they were not subject to US sales restrictions.\n\nFiorina continued the HP scheme to get computers to Iran after she took over as CEO. Her compliance in violating US sanctions against Iran was highlighted in the Boston Globe in 2008 when Fiorina was attempting to unseat California Senator Barbara Boxer. The issue torpedoed her campaign then \u2013 and it could very well sink Fiorina again. Senator Boxer thought so when she told MSNBC: \u201cSo she\u2019s got so many problems. I say if the Republicans choose her, we\u2019ll walk into the presidency.\u201d\n\nDuring the first GOP debate, Fiorina declared that on her first day in office she would call Iranian leader Ali Khameni with the following message: \u201cUntil you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around.\u201d As CEO of Hewlett-Packard, however, Fiorina had no problem with Iran moving money into her own company\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt reminds us of another American businessman-turned Republican politician who got wealthy doing business with a government hostile toward the US.

We thought it was unsound, but you made us do it,\u2019\u201d Crocker told The Times. \u201cIt\u2019s just indicative of their whole approach to Syria, which is not to have a policy. This is the worst thing they could say.\u201d\n\nThe administration's new argument also flies in the face of a furious push to secure funding for the proposal last year. Obama pressed Congress to pass $500 million amid widespread suspicion from his own Democratic allies. The legislation ultimately ended up prompting more than 90 Democrats in the House and Senate to vote against the president's priority.\n\nWhen it passed through Congress, he hailed it as a the best option to help \"destroy ISIL without American troops fighting another ground war in the Middle East.\"\n\n'Doctors, farmers, pharmacists'\n\nObama has always been skeptical about supporting nationalist Syrian rebels attempting to topple Assad.\n\nObama famously told The New York Times that the notion arming the rebels would have made a difference has \u201calways been a fantasy\" because the opposition of \"former doctors, farmers, pharmacists, and so forth\" was fighting \"a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, [and] a battle-hardened Hezbollah.\"\n\nIn 2014, Hof wrote that the recommendation to arm the moderate opposition was offered in some form by Clinton \u2014 who is now running to succeed Obama in the White House \u2014 as well as then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, then-CIA Director David Petraeus, and outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Martin Dempsey.\n\n\"From the beginning there has been no shortage of criticism \u2014 both internal and external \u2014 and alternatives, culminating in our Atlantic Council April 2015 'Syrian National Stabilization Force' study,\" Hof told Business Insider.\n\n\"There is no Obama administration strategy for Syria. There never has been one. It's running out of time to come up with one.\"\n\nNow, four-plus years into the Syrian civil war, the worsening situation for the Obama administration is becoming clear: Russia is flying in arms and troops to help bolster the regime of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nMore than half the Syrian population has been displaced, spawning a growing and tragic refugee crisis spanning across Europe. And more than 250,000 people are dead, while Assad continues to barrel bomb his country's own citizens.\n\nObama has long publicly hoped to avoid getting mired in the Syrian crisis. Observers argue that's a result both of a war-weary public and a desire to clinch a nuclear deal with Iran, which is Assad's primary backer, along with Russia.\n\n\"They don\u2019t have an overall Syria strategy,\" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group. \"It\u2019s been one of the two biggest strategic failures of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy. (The other being Russia.)\n\n\"Obama's approach with Syria has consistently been risk-averse. Try not to get sucked into a crisis where there are no easy answers ... but then as consistently respond when the pressure to 'do something' becomes too great.\"\n\nCritics argue that Obama's strategic foreign-policy missteps \u2014 dealing with the Syrian conflict and with Russia and its unpredictable president, Vladimir Putin \u2014 are merging as Russia and Iran double down on their support of Assad's regime.\n\nObama may not see the end of the Syrian crisis before he leaves office after next year; Defense Secretary Ash Carter certainly doesn't think so. And so now, incidentally, he's been forced into perhaps the only realistic option he's sown with his strategy.\n\n\"The United States doesn\u2019t have the economic or military will to change the balance of forces on the ground themselves,\" Bremmer said. \"And we don\u2019t have the potential allies in Syria to act as an effective proxy. Accordingly, we\u2019ve just announced we\u2019re going to start talking to the Russians about Syria.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m sure that was an incredibly unpleasant decision for the Obama administration to make \u2014 especially after all that talk of isolating Russia for their bad behavior.

His capture had a devastating impact on the couple whose lives he was filming at the time, but they say it was worth it for the film they made together.\n\nSpoiler warning: Details of the film A Syrian Love Story are revealed\n\nFrom his prison cell, Sean McAllister could hear the screams of Syria's revolutionaries. It was October 2011 and the country was slipping deeper into war. McAllister, a film-maker, had been jumped on by secret police in Damascus, blindfolded, and brought to the prison, where he became a witness to the regime's brutal treatment of protesters and activists.\n\n\"There's a sort of softening-up torture, with these 20-year-old kids with inner tubes and cables and they just whip and whip and whip, and you just hear people screaming in different rooms,\" he recalls. \"They do that for a couple of hours before they bundle them into windowless dungeons where there's hardly enough room to sit down.\"\n\nWhen he was released, McAllister's testimony made headlines, but at the time his thoughts were focused on the family he had been filming for a documentary, which is now on release in the UK. A Syrian Love Story follows two married activists, Amer Daoud and Raghda Hasan, and their children over a five-year period.\n\nWhen McAllister was detained in 2011, the authorities took his equipment, which contained footage of the couple speaking out against the regime and organising protests. But when the police demanded to know where they were, McAllister misdirected them, giving Daoud and Hasan time to flee to Lebanon.\n\n\"At that point I felt terribly guilty, but then after that for the next year it was terrible, because they were then suffering, stuck in Beirut,\" says McAllister.\n\nHaving become very much part of the story, McAllister continued to film the family - and they did nothing to stop him.\n\n\"I actually thought Sean was a window of hope,\" says Daoud. \"Because we are political activists. As political activists you have a higher goal in life, you have a message that you want to convey and communicate as well.\"\n\nImage caption Sean McAllister and Amer Daoud\n\nMcAllister had arrived in Syria in 2008, seeking a break from his work in war zones and curious about life in what he calls a \"functioning dictatorship\".

Then, one night in a park in Damascus, he met Daoud, who told him: \"If you really want to make a film about Syria, come and film me.\"\n\nMcAllister had found his story about Syria - and it was a love story.\n\nA member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, Daoud had spent three years in prison, where he had formed a relationship with the woman in the adjacent cell. Raghda Hasan's background was very different - she came from the same Alawite sect as the president - but she was also a dissident, a communist revolutionary. The two made a small hole in the wall separating them and, after months of communicating through it, they fell in love. When they were released from prison, they got married and had two children together.\n\n\"All we wanted was to be together all the time - and nothing would separate us, even death,\" recalls Daoud.\n\nBut at the time McAllister met him and his children, Hasan was in prison once again for writing a novel based on the couple's relationship, among other things.\n\nHasan was released again in 2011 as part of an amnesty, one of the Syrian government's responses to the Arab Spring.\n\nBut not long afterwards, the family had to make their escape to Lebanon and it was there that the marriage began to break down. Unable to live at a distance from the revolution she had longed for and worked towards, Hasan returned to Syria. And without her, her husband and children were unable to seek asylum in Europe.\n\nThe family eventually reunited and sought refuge in France, but exile - the life of the refugee - did not bring happiness.\n\nIn long, claustrophobic scenes shot in the couple's apartment - the Sheffield documentary festival, which awarded the film its top prize earlier this year, drew parallels with the work of Ingmar Bergman - the viewer is witness to the couple's rancour and mutual recrimination. There is an affair. There is a suicide attempt.\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to Sean McAllister and Amer Daoud speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nA Syrian Love Story is in UK cinemas now and will be on BBC television in the UK on 28 September\n\n\"It was bizarre,\" says McAllister, \"because they were in Albi, this idyllic, beautiful place in the south of France, which is I guess the dream - and I was thinking back to the beginning of this journey, when they'd been dreaming of freedom and in this bizarre kind of way, this was freedom.\n\n\"But in getting there they'd lost so much and each other - and they couldn't make sense of themselves or where they were.\"\n\nThey began to look to McAllister to make sense of it all for them. They both rang him regularly, asking him to come to France to act as a prosecuting counsel or judge in their quarrels. Instead, he was a witness, albeit one with powers to cross-examine.\n\n\"When you were a prisoner, he loved you,\" McAllister reminds Hasan at one point. \"All Syrians love prisoners,\" she replies.\n\n\"No,\" McAllister says, \"he loved his wife.\"\n\nAgain and again, we see the family reviewing McAllister's footage from 2010 and 2011 - a record of their earlier family life that doubles as a reminder of the country they had left behind and of friends and relatives who had been killed.\n\nHasan now lives in Turkey, where she has a role in Syria's opposition government. Daoud still lives in France, along with the children. He watched the final cut of McAllister's film on a laptop in a cafe.\n\n\"When I watched the film, I thought: 'There's me, there's my wife and my children.' And I couldn't hold back my tears,\" says Daoud. \"I cried for hours and hours on my own, just feeling sorry for myself and my life, feeling sorry for my children, feeling sorry for Raghda. What is now and what could have been - all these thoughts were just going through my mind for days after watching the film.\"\n\nDaoud believes that his marriage would not have broken down if Syria had been at peace. \"I'm sure,\" he says, \"because we have a great love story.\"\n\nWhen McAllister began filming in 2010, he could not foresee the Arab Spring or the civil war. For much of the last five years he worked on the film as a \"labour of love\" without a commission from a network. But then came another unexpected development - the sudden interest from the media in the plight of Syrian refugees.\n\nSean McAllister and Amer Daoud spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service.

Sitting at her kitchen table one recent afternoon in front of a stack of Securus bills, Jones explained that her 29-year-old son, Nate Jones, had been arrested on an aggravated robbery charge in January 2014. Her son\u2019s life may have taken a negative turn, but Jones tries to keep in touch with him as often as possible. They speak roughly once a week in a 15-minute phone call, and speak for another 25 minutes on a video chat. Jones says she\u2019d travel to Texas to visit her son in person, but Hays County Jail, where he is locked up, banned visitations in November 2013. That happened shortly after the county jail entered into a contract with Securus. The cost to keep in touch, Jones says, \u201cmakes me ill.\u201d Since then, all family communication with inmates at Hays County goes through Securus, which charges Jones about $10 for a phone call and about $8 for a video visit. In the year and a half that her son has been locked up, Jones says she has racked up over $1,000 in bills with Securus to keep in contact with her son. The cost to keep in touch, Jones says, \u201cmakes me ill.\u201d Over the last decade, the prison phone business has become a scandalous industry, characterized by lawsuits, exorbitant fees, high phone rates and monopolistic relationships between public jails and private companies that openly offer kickbacks to local sheriffs. In May 2015, Foster Campbell, the Louisiana Public Service commissioner, described the prison phone business in his state as \u201cworse than any payday loan scheme.\u201d \u201cRegardless of what they\u2019re using the money for, this is about shifting the cost of the police state onto the backs of the poor people being policed,\u201d says Paul Wright, executive director of Human Rights Defense Center and a longtime advocate for more affordable prison phone rates. In June, Jones provided International Business Times with her Securus-related bills. Even a cursory examination of the documents reveals several questionable fees, including a $3.99 \u201cwireless administration fee,\u201d and a $7.95 payment processing fee every time she loads money into Nate\u2019s commissary account. At Hays County jail, where her son is incarcerated, a 25-minute video call costs $7.99, which is actually a pretty good price compared to the the $20 (for a 20-minute call) she paid Securus when he was locked up in nearby Bastrop County Jail. A 15-minute phone call, also operated by Securus, costs $9.29, plus tax. Ironically, because of recent Federal Communications Commission regulations, out-of-state calls should be a little bit cheaper, but because Jones has a Texas area code on her cell phone, the calls are more expensive. On a recent Wednesday afternoon, Jones and her son spoke to each other on a video chat. As she anxiously waited for his face to appear on the screen, she trained her eyes on the little digital box where he was set to appear. Finally, when his face showed up in the display, her eyes lit up. \u201cHi Nate!\u201d she exclaimed. She asked about the weather down in Texas and his haircut. They also discussed the latest novel they\u2019ve begun reading simultaneously: \u201cThe Goldfinch.\u201d It\u2019s about a young boy who survives an attack that kills his mother. Because Nate has not yet been convicted of a crime, Jones\u2019 lawyers have urged her not to speak about her son\u2019s case. But Jones says Nate already is taking steps to turn his life around behind bars. She says he recently was accepted into a college correspondence course in Colorado, where he plans to study business and entrepreneurship. In the meantime, he passes the time by reading novels and playing Sudoku. Nate is just one of an estimated 2.2 million inmates currently behind bars in America. If you\u2019ve ever tried to call an inmate, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve heard of Securus, or its main competitor, Global Tel*Link (GTL). GTL was recently featured by Bloomberg, which reported that NPR spent $2,500 on phone bills to report for its \u201cSerial\u201d podcast. Lupe Fiasco, a popular rapper from Chicago\u2019s South Side, even sings about \u201cspendin\u2019 50 thousand on Securus\u201d on a recent track. The two companies reportedly make up about 80 percent of the prison phone business, which drives about $1.2 billion per year in revenues. In the last few years, Securus, especially, has emerged into one of the largest, if not most secretive, prison technology companies in the business. The company employs 1,000 associates in 46 states, contracts with 2,600 jails and prisons across North America, and provides service to more than 1 million inmates and their families. About 400,000 phone calls are placed each day, according to company statements. Securus positions itself a \u201chigh-tech\u201d operator that pours its resources into research and development. \u201cWe lead the industry with all of our technology solutions,\u201d Rick Smith, CEO of Securus Technologies, said in a recent press release. Jones chafes at statements like that. She says the video calls are grainy and prone to drop, and she notes that Securus\u2019 system does not even support Apple Macs, which Securus acknowledges on their website. Regardless, because consumers have little choice in the provider they use, business has been good for Securus: Abry Partners, a Boston-based private equity group, acquired a major stake in Securus in 2013 for $640 million. Securus executives have long-refuted the notion that they are a particularly profitable company. In 2013, Rick Smith said that prison advocates \u201cembellish\u201d the profitability of the prison phone business. At a July 2014 hearing with the FCC, Smith argued that, compared to other phone operators--from Verizon to AT&T--Securus\u2019 profits were actually quite small. \u201cWe don\u2019t earn excessive profits,\u201d Rick Smith said at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t earn excessive profits. We don\u2019t earn excessive profits. I said that three times for the egregious and abusive and predatory kinds of comments that come at us most of the time.\u201d However, leaked company documents from a Securus investor presentation, which were obtained and published by the Huffington Post, and later reported by the New York Post and the Prison Policy Initiative, tell a different story. The slides show that Securus earned $114.6 million in profits in 2014, on revenues of about $404 million -- margins comparable to companies like Apple and Google. In an e-mail, Securus\u2019 Smith said \u201cthe HuffPost\u201d received three PowerPoint slides \u201cillegally\u201d from \u201cour recent bank presentation\u201d but did not comment on their authenticity. He also declined a request for an interview. On June 17, Securus noted in a letter to the FCC that \u201cthe figures set forth in the article are simply incorrect or taken in the incorrect context.\u201d A week later, on June 25, the Human Rights Defense Center wrote in a letter to the FCC that \u201cSecurus did not explain why, if the data was inaccurate, it was included in the company\u2019s investor presentation.\u201d Either way, those profit numbers are of particular interest to the FCC. By the end of this summer, the FCC will expand its 2013 regulations on the prison phone business. The new regulations have the potential to present a historic shift in the prison phone business. Should the FCC decide to limit commissions paid to sheriffs and cap excessive fees companies are allowed to charge consumers, the new rules could fundamentally change the way the industry operates. The reform is welcomed by advocates and their families -- but, perhaps not too surprisingly, Securus is on the defensive. After all, billions of dollars are at stake. The prison phone business has been characterized by relationships between public jails and private companies that openly offer kickbacks to local sheriffs. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who was appointed to office by President Barack Obama in 2009, is looking very closely at how companies like Securus operate and make money. \u201cPeople should be treated with as much dignity and respect as possible, even if they are incarcerated,\u201d Clyburn said in an exclusive interview with IBTimes. \u201cThese families deserve the same level of consideration than any other consumer of a telecommunications product. They deserve that. I am committed to answer that call.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe prison phone business is a wildly complex, fiercely secretive and enormously lucrative industry. Already, interested parties have held quiet skirmishes behind the scenes to protect their interests. Perhaps the most controversial element of the FCC plan to rein in the costs of prisoner calls is to limit the amount of commissions that get paid back to county sheriffs. Critics like Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, say it\u2019s the commissions, ultimately, that have driven costs so high. When companies like Securus send proposals to jails and prisons around the country, they offer a percentage of the call rate back to the sheriff\u2019s office. Jail administrators say that allowing inmates to speak on the phones cost them money, because they need to pay guards to monitor the calls. It\u2019s typical for commissions to range anywhere from 40 percent and 80 percent. They can be higher. In Arizona, for instance, commissions have reached as much as 93.9 percent of the call revenue, according to Cronkite News. The size of these commissions -- and the price at which companies like Securus place their rates -- are often big factors in winning the bid with the jail or prison. \u201cIn a normal market, people that use a product get to pick the product based on the features that benefit them,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cHere, the decisions are made by a third party -- in this case, the facility who have a financial incentive in making sure that the rates are as high as possible.\u201d Critics say commissions paid to sheriffs help drive up prison phone fees. At Hays County Jail, where Joanne Jones\u2019 son is incarcerated, Securus collects $9.29 for each call placed by him. However, reports show that Securus then pays up to 58 percent, or $5.39, back to the Hays County sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nIn fact, this relationship has become something of a marketing selling point for companies like Securus. Securus boasts that over the last 10 years, it has generated some $1.3 billion in commissions. Wagner says that allowing jails and prisons to recover their costs makes sense; but this dynamic has been exploited for financial gain for local police departments around the country. Perhaps not surprisingly, sheriffs who run the jails -- and who collect the commissions -- are not pleased with the decision to limit their revenues. In response to the suggestion that the FCC might eliminate commissions, more than 200 sheriffs recently filed letters of opposition with the FCC, claiming they\u2019ll rip the phones from the wall if the government takes away their commissions. In other words, if the government takes away their commissions, the sheriffs will take away the phones from inmates and their families. After all, the sheriffs argue that they incur a variety of costs by providing the phone service, and the commissions help alleviate the financial burden. When reached by telephone earlier this year, Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs Association, told IBTimes that, should the FCC do away with commissions, \u201cit\u2019s very possible that sheriffs could elect to eliminate the calls ... they don\u2019t have to provide a call service.\u201d Thompson did not return followup e-mails. In theory, sheriffs are supposed to use this money to offset the cost of providing the phone services and provide inmate welfare services. However, some critics allege there\u2019s very little cost actually incurred by offering the service, especially because companies like Securus will pay for the installation themselves. In 2011, for instance, Securus paid the Hays County Jail $40,000 for the privilege of installing the phones, according to news reports at the time. \u201cEvery single filing I\u2019ve ever seen from the sheriffs is about the money,\u201d says Wright. \u201cThat\u2019s all they\u2019re talking about.\n\nPaul Wright, head of the Human Rights Defense Center, also says that there\u2019s little oversight over the money that\u2019s generated from these commissions, and the funds are often misspent. For instance, in the Orange County Jail in California in 2010, the inmate welfare services fund grew to $5,016,429. Of that sum, 74 percent was used to pay staff salaries, according to documents filed with the FCC. About 0.8% was used for inmate educational programs and 0.06% was used for inmate re-entry programs. \u201cEvery single filing I\u2019ve ever seen from the sheriffs is about the money,\u201d says Wright. \u201cThat\u2019s all they\u2019re talking about. They aren\u2019t giving a rat\u2019s ass about safety, about recidivism, encouraging family contact, keeping people out of jail in the first place -- it\u2019s literally all about \u2018Hey, we got budgets, and we need money.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, many politicians are standing firm with the law enforcement community. A review of documents filed with the FCC reveals that six members of Congress have lobbied in support of the sheriffs. They urge the FCC to consider how reducing phone rates and commissions could affect the jails\u2019 ability to monitor calls -- as well as how regulations could affect county budgets. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, wrote in a letter to the FCC dated Sept. 4, 2014, that, although his office supports making rates fair for families, \u201cthe enforcement community is understandably alarmed about how potential Inmate Calling System rate changes might affect revenues.\u201d Warner notes that his Virginia district receives $13.5 million from prison telephones. Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., similarly wrote on Dec. 11, 2014, that \u201cit is not unreasonable to allow the use of [inmate calling service] monies to fund other general services needed at prisons.\u201d Other legislators disagree with the approach. \u201cIt is an absolute abuse of a situation,\u201d said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat from New Jersey, said in an interview with IBTimes. \u201cThere should be no profit associated with keeping a family connected, even with an individual who has made a mistake and is paying for it by being incarcerated.\u201d\n\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look for this country to be concerned about profitability on the backs of people who are poor and people who are incarcerated.\"\n\nShe added, \u201cThis is not a good look for the United States of America. It\u2019s not a good look for this country to be concerned about profitability on the backs of people who are poor and people who are incarcerated.\u201d\n\nOne may wonder how companies like Securus can turn such staggering profits if they are giving so much of the calling money back to sheriffs.\n\nThe answer, according to experts, may be relatively straightforward: Unregulated fees and \u201csingle-call\u201d programs, which charge as high as $14.95 for a single 15-minute phone call. \u201cThe company is hiding the revenue it collects from fees,\u201d says Peter Wagner of the Prison Policy Initiative. \u201cThe business model has evolved so that the business model is what I call \u201cfee harvesting,\u201d says Peter Wagner, director of the Prison Policy Initiative. \u201cRather than actually selling phone service and making money as a phone company, the phone calls are just a gimmick in order to charge the fees, because that\u2019s where the real money is.\u201d Wagner has spent considerable time and resources studying Securus\u2019 business model. Because commissions paid to sheriffs are only based on the call rates -- and not the fees -- Wagner says companies like Securus have increased the number of fees to recoup the lost revenue from the commissions. \u201cThe companies playing the fee game look generous because they are promising to share up to 99% of the rate revenue with facilities,\u201d Wagner wrote in a June report. \u201cBut that \u201cgenerosity\u201d is only possible because the company is hiding the revenue it collects from fees.\u201d\n\nIn September 2014, Securus, along with Global Tel*Link and Telmate, the two other major prison phone providers, presented a nine-page proposal to the FCC on what they believed a fair regulation would look like. In it, they address commissions, fees and the costs of providing phone services. The proposal asks the FCC to institute \u201cflat rate caps\u201d of 20 cents per minute. Critics, like Paul Wright and the Human Rights Defense Center, don\u2019t believe 20 cents is fair. They advocate a call rate of 6 cents per minute. Wright notes that if the FCC decides to eliminate the commission structure -- and therefore get to keep the entirety of the call revenue -- the proposal would actually, ironically, be a win-win for companies like Securus. Detention Officer Rene Ansley looks on as visitors use video phones to talk with inmates at Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s Maricopa County \"tent city\" jail in Phoenix May 3, 2010. Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images In a recent filing with the FCC, Wright pointed out that the actual costs companies like Securus bear to provide the phone services are remarkably low. West Virginia, for instance, recently imposed the lowest rates and commissions in the country: All calls will now cost 3.5 cents per minute, while the correctional facility will take 0.1% commission. \u201cThis is not only another example of the low costs that [inmate calling service] providers can charge and still make a profit,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut also more evidence of the link between lower rates and an effective elimination of the commission.\u201d In order to decide on an appropriate rate, the FCC asked all of the prison phone companies to supply it with their costs. Securus complied with the FCC under the condition that its cost documents would not be available to the public under a protective seal. In late April, IBTimes filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FCC to release Securus documents pertaining to the true costs of operating in prisons and jails. The request was ultimately denied by the FCC after a series of stern objections from Securus\u2019 legal counsel, Stephanie Joyce, who wrote that should any of Securus\u2019 cost documents leak, \u201cthe likelihood of irreparable, devastating harm is extremely high.\u201d\n\nThough some may consider it an unsavory business, the prison technology industry appears to be an attractive bet for investors. In 2013, Abry Partners of Boston bought a major stake in Securus. One of the private equity group\u2019s core values is to invest in high-growth businesses that have \u201cpredictable, recurring revenues -- such as subscription-like businesses with high customer retention rates.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, for now at least, how Abry views Securus in light of the new round of FCC regulations. Abry did not return a request for an interview. Over the past few years, Securus has expanded into a variety of new services, including video visitations and electronic monitoring. In other words, they\u2019ve seemed to be able to leverage their profits to expand their business. Backed by Abry, Securus was able to purchase JPay, a prison payment-processing company that also sells tablets to inmates, for a reported $205 million. According to a recent company press release, Securus has purchased 13 companies in the last 39 months. \u201cSecurus\u2019 solutions have been very successful and are reaching new milestones of success in keeping our world safe and connecting what matters,\u201d the company noted. Recently, the company opened a 10,000-square-foot \u201ctechnology center\u201d to show off their new products.", "It's up to you to build support for petitions you care about and gather more signatures.

Scott Walker boasted that he \u201ctook on union bosses from Washington\u201d in his 2011 effort to crush state public-employee union rights.\n\nBut according to a stunning, detailed new statement by a former top Republican legislative aide, it turns out that Walker isolated himself and hid in tightly controlled, heavily-guarded environments during the conflict covering six intense weeks in early 2011\u2014which directly contradicts his tall tale of courageously facing his adversaries.\n\n\u201cOur unintimidated governor continued to only participate in private events with the media excluded or tightly controlled,\u201d wrote Michael Boerger, former top aide to retired Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis, in a September 10 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion piece.\n\nUnintimidated is the title of Walker\u2019s fact-challenged biography that recounts fiercely battling tens of thousands of pro-labor advocates as he pushed Act 10 into law. The legislation stripped most Wisconsin employees of any practical rights to union representation.\n\nWalker\u2019s reliance on his oft-told tale of political courage did not help deliver a breakout performance to counter his slipping poll numbers at Wednesday\u2019s debate. But Boerger\u2019s astonishing account of a man who hid from his critics and the public\u2014but later boasted of facing down enemies\u2014could mark a turning point for his 2016 ambitions.\n\nAs Boerger noted in his recent Milwaukee Journal Sentinel op-ed, while Walker sat quivering in fear, Madison police reported virtually no violence despite crowds of up to 150,000 protesters who stayed peaceful throughout the protracted battle over the legislation.\n\nWalker is a promoting a national anti-labor agenda as a cornerstone of his presidential campaign. In March, he signed a \u201cright-to-work\u201d bill for Wisconsin despite repeated assurances to the public and in private to conservative labor leaders that such a bill would never reach his desk. More recently, he has called for federal right-to-work laws, which discourage union membership and suppress wages, banning federal employee unions and closing the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nEven those who know Walker best are not impressed with his latest anti-union plans. Milwaukee\u2019s Journal Sentinel, a conservative paper which endorsed Walker three times for governor, dismissed his call for \u201cAct 10 nationwide\u201d and basically called him a serial liar.\n\n\u201cIt is more politicking from a governor who as recently as last year when running for re-election called right-to-work a distraction, then proceeded to sign the legislation anyway when it passed the Legislature,\u201d it editorialized. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growing distrust of Walker are Boerger\u2019s revelations that reveal Walker was hardly \u201cunintimidated\u201d in confronting unions. Last winter, candidate Walker ridiculously said that his battle with unionists showed that he could stand up to ISIS terrorists.\n\nWalker has also repeatedly said that he showed leadership by pushing Republican legislative leaders to fully support Act 10, which Boerger resented. His op-ed opened, \u201cAs a front-row witness to the sad history of the passage of Act 10, I have to refute the notion currently being advanced by Gov. Scott Walker that he faced stiff opposition to his proposal from GOP legislative leaders.\u201d\n\nBoerger\u2019s comments reflect the bitterness of Republicans who feel that they took the brunt of criticism from voters and were forced to engage in extraordinary anti-democratic tactics to prevent a high-profile loss for the new governor under an international spotlight\u2014as the Madison rebellion coincided with a popular uprising in Egypt and captured international headlines and TV coverage. Despite the GOP legislators\u2019 willingness to bend the rules to pass Act 10 for Walker, they saw themselves as unappreciated by the governor.\n\n\u201cEvery day that spring, legislators had to run a gantlet of protesters and meet in public in the Capitol for committee meetings and legislative sessions,\u201d stated Boerger. \u201cMeanwhile, our unintimidated governor was making speeches in minutely controlled, private venues that often even excluded attendance by the media.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Walker was so petrified of any direct challenge that he initially planned to deliver his high-profile budget address away from the State Capitol in a more tightly-guarded site, Boerger said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, the governor even planned to give his budget address outside the Capitol in such a private, security-dominated venue. Unintimidated? It was GOP leaders who convinced the governor to appear in public, in the statehouse as every other governor has done.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first account that has revealed Walker\u2019s self-described profile in courage as a big lie. While Republican legislators often faced protesters in heated dialogue as they circulated around the Capitol, Walker remained cloistered in his heavily-guarded office and \u201cslunk to and from the state Capitol via underground tunnels\u201d with armed escorts, Guardian journalist Jeb Lund reported.\n\nAs Walker\u2019s presidential ambitions keep floundering, it is beginning to appear that he is fated to return his bunker at the Capitol\u2014where he hid when he first launched his attack on labor and nurtured his presidential ambitions. But this time, he would be hiding from everyone who he used to fan his presidential ambitions.", "\u200bBoy howdy, that's a serious burial job that the Washington Post did on the campaign of Scott Walker, the goggle-eyed homunculus hired by Koch Industries to manage their Midwest subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin. His numbers are plunging. His donors are fleeing. His campaign staff is turning swiftly into a Machiavellian papacy.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "BY: Follow @Kredo0\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration is declining to inform Congress about the number of American citizens and troops killed by Iran and its terror proxies, according to a document provided to Congress and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nThe administration was repeatedly asked by Congress to release figures describing how many Americans and Israelis have been killed by Iran\u2019s military and terror activities since the country\u2019s 1979 revolution.\n\nIn a series of on-the-record responses obtained exclusively by the Free Beacon, and provided in written form to Sen.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Shell will be allowed to freely spill oil into the ocean for three weeks, potentially wreaking environmental havoc on Canada's amazing marine life, major fishing grounds, coastal communities and the Sable Island National Park Reserve, the world's largest breeding colony of grey seals.\n\nNow it's down to the offshore oil regulator -- the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB) -- to decide whether to approve the application.\n\nIf our global community protests Shell's drilling Nova Scotia, we will send a signal that wherever it goes to drill and destroy, we'll be there too.\n\nTell the CNSOPB to refuse Shell's application to drill in Nova Scotia.\n\nOver four years, Shell wants to drill up to seven exploratory wells, which are especially risky and prone to large spill.

And worse, some of the backup safety equipment is located in South Africa, a staggering 12,000 kilometres away.\n\n\n\nShell is not only gambling with Nova Scotia, it is wreaking havoc all over the world. It recently got the go ahead to drill the Arctic, putting our entire ecosystem in danger and contributing massively to climate change.\n\nBP's Deepwater Horizon disaster taught us just how devastating a prolonged blowout can be for wildlife, habitat and livelihoods. But some believe a blowout in Shell's wells in Nova Scotia, Canada could be even worse. The oil wells would be in much deeper water and a much harsher environment. And honestly, no one trusts Shell ability to deal with it.\n\nThe SumOfUs community has stood up to Big Oil's destruction of the environment, and we've had a major impact. Hundreds of thousands of us came together to stop Shell from drilling in the Arctic, and to demand that Chevron pay for its crimes in the Amazon. Now, let's stand together to keep Shell out of Nova Scotia.\n\n\n\nCanada-Nova Scotia Petroleum Board: refuse Shell's application to drill in Nova Scotia!\n\n**********\n\n\n\nMore information:\n\nShell gets OK to take 21 days to cap blowouts off Nova Scotia coast, CBC News, 5 August 2015\n\nCanada Gives Shell Permission to Leave Future Offshore Well Blowout Uncapped for 21 Days, the U.S. Gives 24 Hours, DeSmog Canada, 7 August 2015\n\nCanadian agency deciding Shell's offshore drilling includes ex-Shell official, The Guardian, 27 August 2015.", "BY: Follow @Kredo0\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration is declining to inform Congress about the number of American citizens and troops killed by Iran and its terror proxies, according to a document provided to Congress and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nThe administration was repeatedly asked by Congress to release figures describing how many Americans and Israelis have been killed by Iran\u2019s military and terror activities since the country\u2019s 1979 revolution.\n\nIn a series of on-the-record responses obtained exclusively by the Free Beacon, and provided in written form to Sen.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "Scott Walker Was Coward During 2011 Wisconsin Protests\n\nPhoto Credit: https://www.scottwalker.com/\n\nOnce again at Wednesday\u2019s presidential debate, Wisconsin Gov.

The text has been amended with the correction of a factual error and includes responses throughout the piece from Sen. Reid\u2019s communications director, Adam Jentleson. Those passages appear in italics.\n\nCORRECTIONS: A previous version of the article said that the Bullhead City parcel did not appear on Sen. Reid\u2019s 2012 financial disclosure. In fact, the property is listed in the documents. Also, this article had said that Sen. Reid spent \u201capproximately eight years\u201d working as a private practice attorney. In fact, the correct span is at least 14 years between 1964 and 1982, while Reid also held several public offices. (His spokesman is unsure if he practiced law regularly while serving as lieutenant governor.)\n\nThe first of two parts\n\nLast month, as the Senate was busy negotiating the final details of its Ukraine aid package, Majority Leader Harry Reid became temporarily distracted with a campaign finance issue. Since winning re-election in 2010, Reid\u2019s campaign had purchased gifts for supporters and donors from vendors like Bed Bath & Beyond, Amazon, Nordstrom, and the Senate gift shop, among others. But one round of spending was directed to a less recognizable firm: Ryan Elisabeth, a jewelry line.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the campaign spent $31,267 purchasing gifts from the company, which is owned by Reid\u2019s granddaughter, Ryan Elisabeth Reid. All told, she took in nearly seven times more cash than all vendors of donor gifts combined during that period of time.\n\nVeteran Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston first reported the news after receiving a tip about the expenditures. (Ryan Elisabeth\u2019s last name did not appear on the FEC reports, and the senator\u2019s office initially failed to confirm her identity.) While Sen. Reid does not appear to have broken the law, he understood that the purchases created a perception of favoritism. Lamenting the unwanted attention heaped on his granddaughter, he decided after the news broke that \u201cit would be best to pay for her work out of my own pocket.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time that Reid had mixed family and politics -- or potentially run afoul of ethics rules.\n\nHarry Reid has spent more than 40 years in government, starting as a small city\u2019s attorney and eventually becoming the most powerful senator in the country. He has raised tens of millions of dollars in political contributions, established himself as an institution in Nevada politics along the way, and made himself a very wealthy man. His humble roots -- from growing up in a remote desert town to working six days a week as a Capitol police officer while in law school -- are legend in Washington and Nevada. Reid exhibits the toughness of a once destitute boy who completely transformed his life through determination, hard work -- and good luck.\n\nSome who have watched Reid closely over the years, however, say that his political and economic ascendance has made him increasingly willing to use his power (and apparent electoral resilience) in ways that appear unsavory or nepotistic. The jewelry purchases are only the latest example.\n\nDavid Damore -- a University of Nevada, Las Vegas professor whose research focuses on Silver State politics -- has closely followed Reid for years. He said that the balance between helping family and constituents is a common tension for powerful politicians. \u201cI\u2019m going to put this politely: Their personal interests, they seem to see, represent the common good. They don\u2019t differentiate those two.\u201d\n\nAnother longtime Reid-watcher believes that the latest string of incidents, stretching over the last decade, is just a result of more coverage of Reid -- and not a product of him changing his style.\n\n\u201cAs he\u2019s become more known and a much higher dollar target for his critics, anything he does to assist his family now pegs on the radar,\u201d said John L. Smith, a columnist who has written about Nevada politics for nearly as long as Reid has been in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed his personal method of operation throughout his whole career.\u201d\n\nSmith added, \u201cI can\u2019t see him ever denying his family a break or an opportunity if he could provide it. I guess that\u2019s just part of being a dad and a guy with a certain level of influence.\u201d\n\nNowhere is Reid\u2019s influence more profound than in his home state, where he has built a dizzying network of mutually beneficial political, personal, and business alliances. These associations benefit Reid, his family, his close friends, and, very often, the state that he loves. The sphere of influence took decades to create.\n\nAfter returning from law school at the George Washington University, Reid was hired as city attorney in Henderson (the southern Nevada city where he had attended high school and met his wife, Landra). In 1966, he ran for a position on a local hospital\u2019s board of trustees after, he recalled, being taken aback at the chairman of the board\u2019s rudeness.\n\nHe won the election and two years later sought a promotion to the Nevada Assembly. While in the Assembly, Reid further developed relationships with important players in state politics and began honing his image as a strong consumer advocate. After two busy years introducing a record number of bills, Nevadans elected Reid to be their 25th lieutenant governor. (He ran on a ticket with Mike O\u2019Callaghan, a close friend and mentor.)\n\nAt 31, the boy who had grown up in an alcoholic miner\u2019s cabin stood just a heartbeat away from becoming his state\u2019s most powerful politician. But Reid felt he could achieve even more.\n\nHe ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1974 but narrowly lost, despite the wide expectation that he would win. Reid later told The New Yorker, \u201cEverything was in my favor. But I was young and impulsive and I attacked everybody.\u201d A year later, he ran for mayor of Las Vegas and lost again, that time by a much wider margin. Reid collected himself, temporarily abandoning the pursuit of elective office, and worked as a lawyer in Las Vegas.\n\nBut he returned to public life in 1977 when O\u2019Callaghan, still governor, appointed his former second-in-command to be chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission. The job -- seen then as undesirable, difficult, and perhaps dangerous -- further burnished Reid\u2019s reputation as a tough and honorable public servant. While running the Gaming Commission, Reid publicly jousted with mob bosses, tried to choke someone for attempting to bribe him (in front of FBI agents who were filming the sting), and dealt with the aftermath of his wife discovering a bomb attached to the family car.\n\nBy the time he decided to run for a newly created House seat in 1982, Reid had standing as a politician with uniquely strong integrity -- and guts. He had taken on a powerful telephone company as a freshman in the Nevada Assembly, while also sponsoring innovative air pollution legislation. Nevadans also closely associated him with O\u2019Callaghan, by then a popular former governor nurturing a reformist legacy. Reid\u2019s show of strength and resilience during his Gaming Commission tenure rounded out his picaresque political profile. Still relatively young, he spent just two terms in the House before graduating to the Senate in 1987. He has been there ever since.\n\nBut Reid\u2019s political ascent didn\u2019t stop when he arrived at the upper chamber. A savvy behind-the-scenes player, he became Democratic whip in 1999. After alternating between majority whip and minority whip for several years, his caucus elected him minority leader in 2005. Democrats took control of the Senate after the 2006 midterm elections, and Reid has served as majority leader ever since. For most of the past decade, he has been the most powerful lawmaker in the United States Senate. He is also indisputably the most powerful politician in Nevada -- Democratic or Republican.", "A female zookeeper has been attacked and killed by a tiger at a New Zealand zoo.\n\n\n\nEmergency services were called to the Hamilton zoo, 127km south of Auckland on Sunday morning and police have confirmed the woman died at the scene.\n\n\u2014 Hamilton Zoo (@HamiltonZooNZ) We are deeply saddened to confirm the death of a female staff member today after an attack by one of the zoo\u2019s Sumatran tigers.

They are up four-fold, from 6,300 to 27,000. Another 17,700 claims were made by Albanians, whose country is not at war but does share a European border.\n\nA further 13,900 applicants came from Iraq which, like neighbouring Syria, is being smashed by the Islamic State terrorists.\n\nHalf a million migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, with 156,000 coming in August alone. Rather than claiming asylum in the first safe EU country they reach, which in most cases is Greece or Italy, most head on toward wealthy northern states. More than 250,000 migrants have reached those two countries alone before striking out on the overland trail to their EU haven of choice.\n\nElsewhere, the number of people applying for asylum for the first time in Norway shot up by 81 per cent between April and June, according to the Eurostat figures.\n\nThe increase was the steepest rise experienced by any European country except Latvia and The Netherlands, who report asylum applications rising by 123 per cent and 159 per cent respectively.\n\nNorway\u2019s neighbours, Finland and Denmark, also saw bigger increases of 67 per cent and 66 per cent respectively, while Sweden\u2019s applications rose by 25 percent.\n\nThe oil rich Nordic nation is coming under increasing pressure to accept more refugees, with even the 2,760 applications received over the last three months only adding up to 534 per head of population, compared to 1,467 per head received by the neighbouring Swedes and 997 in Germany.\n\nConservative MP David Davies claimed the new Eurostat figures reveal \u201cthe lie peddled in some quarters that vast numbers of those reaching Europe are from Syria\u201d.\n\nMr Davies said: \u201cMost people who are escaping the war will go to camps in Lebanon or Jordan. Many of those who have opted to risk their lives to come to Europe have done so for economic reasons.\u201d\n\nThe human tsunami is also putting pressure on national balance sheets.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports that Germany\u2019s lead in housing hundreds of thousands of migrants heading to Europe could cost the country tens of billions of euros over the next two years, according to early private estimates.\n\nThe Japanese investment bank Mizuho was one of the first to put a number on it yesterday, saying that accepting up to one million refugees a year over the next two years could cost Berlin \u20ac25 billion although Germany has its own estimate and it is closer to the \u20ac100 billion mark.\n\nThat is derived from a basic calculation of \u20ac12,500 per migrant, according to Peter Chatwell, senior rates strategist at Mizuho.

The index aims to measure aspects of prosperity that typical gross domestic product measurements don\u2019t include, such as entrepreneurship and opportunity, education, and social capital.\n\nRELATED: Measure of prosperity aims to go beyond GDP\n\nThe freedom scores are based on polling data from 2013 indicating citizens\u2019 satisfaction with their nation's handling of civil liberties, freedom of choice, tolerance of ethnic minorities, and tolerance of immigrants. Polling data were provided by Gallup World Poll Service. The index is notable for the way it measures how free people feel, unlike other freedom indices that measure freedom by comparing government policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good report for Obama,\u201d Legatum Institute spokeswoman Cristina Odone told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIn the 2010 report (which relied on data gathered in 2009), the U.S. was ranked ninth in personal freedom, but that ranking has since fallen to 21st, with several countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom passing the U.S.\n\nMORE: Pro-immigration reform right oppose Obama acting unilaterally\n\nThe nation\u2019s overall personal freedom score has declined by 17 percent since 2009, with a 22 percent drop in combined civil liberty and free choice contributing to that decline.\n\nOf the eight categories in the index, personal freedom was America's second lowest performance relative to other countries. The U.S. had its lowest ranking when it came to safety and security (a broad measure of how threatened citizens feel in instances such as walking late at night, or expressing their opinions) \u2014 ranking 31st out of 142 countries.\n\nThe cross-country comparisons in the index should be taken with a grain of salt. The perception of what freedom means in New Zealand, which has the highest personal freedom ranking, may vary from how Americans measure their own personal freedom. But regardless of how the U.S. compares to other countries, there is no denying that Americans felt less free in 2013 after four more years of Obama\u2019s presidency.

Jimmy Carter was an ineffective president who became an exemplary post-president. Bill Clinton appears to be the reverse. All sorts of unproven worst-case-scenario questions float around the web of connections between Bill\u2019s private work, Hillary Clinton\u2019s public role as secretary of State, the Clintons\u2019 quasi-public charity, and Hillary\u2019s noncompliant email system. But the best-case scenario is bad enough: The Clintons have been disorganized and greedy.\n\nThe news today about the Clintons all fleshes out, in one way or another, their lack of interest in policing serious conflict-of-interest problems that arise in their overlapping roles:\n\nThe New York Times has a report about the State Department\u2019s decision to approve the sale of Uranium mines to a Russian company that donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Global Initiative, and that a Russian investment bank promoting the deal paid Bill $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Bill Clinton has received $26 million in speaking fees from entities that also donated to the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reports, \u201c Twenty-two of the 37 corporations nominated for a prestigious State Department award \u2014 and six of the eight ultimate winners \u2014 while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State were also donors to the Clinton family foundation. \u201d\n\nAnd Reuters reports, \u201c Hillary Clinton's family's charities are refiling at least five annual tax returns after a Reuters review found errors in how they reported donations from governments, and said they may audit other Clinton Foundation returns in case of other errors. \u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign is batting down the darkest and most conspiratorial interpretation of these stories, and where this all leads remains to be seen. But the most positive interpretation is not exactly good.\n\nWhen you are a power couple consisting of a former president and a current secretary of State and likely presidential candidate, you have the ability to raise a lot of money for charitable purposes that can do a lot of good. But some of the potential sources of donations will be looking to get something in return for their money other than moral satisfaction or the chance to hobnob with celebrities. Some of them want preferential treatment from the State Department, and others want access to a potential future Clinton administration. To run a private operation where Bill Clinton will deliver a speech for a (huge) fee and a charity that raises money from some of the same clients is a difficult situation to navigate. To overlay that fraught situation onto Hillary\u2019s ongoing and likely future government service makes it all much harder.\n\nAnd yet the Clintons paid little to no attention to this problem. Nicholas Confessore described their operation as \u201ca sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest. It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.\u201d Indeed, as Ryan Lizza reported in 2012, Bill Clinton seemed to see the nexus between his role and his wife\u2019s as a positive rather than a negative:\n\nRegardless of Bill Clinton\u2019s personal feelings about Obama, it didn\u2019t take him long to see the advantages of an Obama Presidency. More than anyone, he pushed Hillary to take the job of Secretary of State. \u201cPresident Clinton was a big supporter of the idea,\u201d an intimate of the Clintons told me. \u201cHe advocated very strongly for it and arguably was the tie-breaking reason she took the job.\u201d For one thing, having his spouse in that position didn\u2019t hurt his work at the Clinton Global Initiative. He invites foreign leaders to the initiative\u2019s annual meeting, and her prominence in the Administration can be an asset in attracting foreign donors. \u201cBill Clinton\u2019s been able to continue to be the Bill Clinton we know, in large part because of his relationship with the White House and because his wife is the Secretary of State,\u201d the Clinton associate continued. \u201cIt worked out very well for him. That may be a very cynical way to look at it, but that\u2019s a fact. A lot of the stuff he\u2019s doing internationally is aided by his level of access.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration wanted Hillary Clinton to use official government email. She didn\u2019t. The Obama administration also demanded that the Clinton Foundation disclose all its donors while she served as Secretary of State. It didn\u2019t comply with that request, either.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 charitable initiatives were a kind of quasi-government run by themselves, which was staffed by their own loyalists and made up the rules as it went along. Their experience running the actual government, with its formal accountability and disclosure, went reasonably well. Their experience running their own privatized mini-state has been a fiasco.", "\"Low-wage hourly workers, especially single parents, face unpredictable and erratic work schedules, which greatly impact their families and livelihoods. Pass the Schedules That Work Act now.\"\n\nThe petition to the U.S. Congress reads:\n\nMillions of low-wage hourly workers, many of whom are parents, are given erratic and unpredictable work schedules by their employers. Work hours like these make it almost impossible to schedule childcare, work at a second job, or go back to school.\n\nRight now, retailers and restaurants are legally allowed to change employees\u2019 schedules at a moment\u2019s notice, without recourse or regard to a worker\u2019s personal situation. But new legislation introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren would end this once and for all. Sen. Warren\u2019s bill, the Schedules That Work Act, would allow employees to have a say in their work schedule and bring more stability to their family\u2019s lives.\n\nWithout basic workplace protections, these workers are one small personal emergency away from losing their jobs and falling more deeply into poverty. We must pressure Congress to protect workers\u2019 access to fair and predictable schedules.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Schedules That Work Act now.\n\nSpecifically, Sen. Warren\u2019s legislation would require employers to:\n\nGive workers with specifics needs, like childcare or health issues, more protections;\n\nAllow employees the right to ask for better schedules to suit their family's needs;\n\nStop retaliating against employees for making work requests;\n\nProvide clear and advance expectations for work schedules, including number of hours or on-call shifts.\n\nThe biggest beneficiaries to predictable schedules may in fact be children. According to a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute, young children of workers who have nonstandard or unpredictable work schedules \u201care more likely to have inferior cognitive and behavioral outcomes.\u201d1\n\nAnd there\u2019s momentum behind giving low-wage workers better schedules. Major retailers including Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Williams-Sonoma are phasing out last minute on-call scheduling, and Starbucks has announced it will be bringing \u201cmore stability and consistency\u201d to workers\u2019 schedules.2\n\nBut not all retailers, restaurants, and other hourly employers have followed suit. That\u2019s why we must increase the pressure on Congress to pass this important legislation and give all workers the benefit of a stable and consistent schedule.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Schedules That Work Act now.\n\nThanks for all you do to stand up for workers.\n\nReferences:", "Americans' assessments of their personal freedom have significantly declined under President Obama, according to a new study from the Legatum Institute in London, and the United States now ranks below 20 other countries on this measure.\n\nThe research shows that citizens of countries including France, Uruguay, and Costa Rica now feel that they enjoy more personal freedom than Americans.\n\nAs the Washington Examiner reported this morning, representatives of the Legatum Institute are in the U.S. this week to promote the sixth edition of their Prosperity Index. The index aims to measure aspects of prosperity that typical gross domestic product measurements don\u2019t include, such as entrepreneurship and opportunity, education, and social capital.\n\nRELATED: Measure of prosperity aims to go beyond GDP\n\nThe freedom scores are based on polling data from 2013 indicating citizens\u2019 satisfaction with their nation's handling of civil liberties, freedom of choice, tolerance of ethnic minorities, and tolerance of immigrants. Polling data were provided by Gallup World Poll Service. The index is notable for the way it measures how free people feel, unlike other freedom indices that measure freedom by comparing government policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good report for Obama,\u201d Legatum Institute spokeswoman Cristina Odone told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIn the 2010 report (which relied on data gathered in 2009), the U.S. was ranked ninth in personal freedom, but that ranking has since fallen to 21st, with several countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom passing the U.S.\n\nMORE: Pro-immigration reform right oppose Obama acting unilaterally\n\nThe nation\u2019s overall personal freedom score has declined by 17 percent since 2009, with a 22 percent drop in combined civil liberty and free choice contributing to that decline.\n\nOf the eight categories in the index, personal freedom was America's second lowest performance relative to other countries. The U.S. had its lowest ranking when it came to safety and security (a broad measure of how threatened citizens feel in instances such as walking late at night, or expressing their opinions) \u2014 ranking 31st out of 142 countries.\n\nThe cross-country comparisons in the index should be taken with a grain of salt. The perception of what freedom means in New Zealand, which has the highest personal freedom ranking, may vary from how Americans measure their own personal freedom. But regardless of how the U.S. compares to other countries, there is no denying that Americans felt less free in 2013 after four more years of Obama\u2019s presidency. And so now he faces the embarrassment of being the president that made Americans feel less free than the French.", "\"Democrats in Congress must stand strong against any Republican attacks on women. No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:", "https://t.co/xxxxxxxxx #news #p2 RT @HillaryClinton .@POTUS is right: When we ensure black women and girls have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, America gets ahead. -H\n\n\n\nReply \u00b7 Report Post", "", "Story highlights Hillary Clinton fired up the most faithful Granite State Democrats on Saturday\n\nThe event is the largest Democratic state party convention in New Hampshire's history\n\nManchester, New Hampshire (CNN) Hillary Clinton fired up the most faithful Granite State Democrats on Saturday, outlining her vision for the future and the rationale behind her run in a well received speech at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's convention here.\n\n\"If you want a president who will tell you everything that is wrong with America and who is to blame for it, you've got plenty of other choices.

The text has been amended with the correction of a factual error and includes responses throughout the piece from Sen. Reid\u2019s communications director, Adam Jentleson. Those passages appear in italics.\n\nCORRECTIONS: A previous version of the article said that the Bullhead City parcel did not appear on Sen. Reid\u2019s 2012 financial disclosure. In fact, the property is listed in the documents. Also, this article had said that Sen. Reid spent \u201capproximately eight years\u201d working as a private practice attorney. In fact, the correct span is at least 14 years between 1964 and 1982, while Reid also held several public offices. (His spokesman is unsure if he practiced law regularly while serving as lieutenant governor.)\n\nThe first of two parts\n\nLast month, as the Senate was busy negotiating the final details of its Ukraine aid package, Majority Leader Harry Reid became temporarily distracted with a campaign finance issue. Since winning re-election in 2010, Reid\u2019s campaign had purchased gifts for supporters and donors from vendors like Bed Bath & Beyond, Amazon, Nordstrom, and the Senate gift shop, among others. But one round of spending was directed to a less recognizable firm: Ryan Elisabeth, a jewelry line.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the campaign spent $31,267 purchasing gifts from the company, which is owned by Reid\u2019s granddaughter, Ryan Elisabeth Reid. All told, she took in nearly seven times more cash than all vendors of donor gifts combined during that period of time.\n\nVeteran Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston first reported the news after receiving a tip about the expenditures. (Ryan Elisabeth\u2019s last name did not appear on the FEC reports, and the senator\u2019s office initially failed to confirm her identity.) While Sen. Reid does not appear to have broken the law, he understood that the purchases created a perception of favoritism. Lamenting the unwanted attention heaped on his granddaughter, he decided after the news broke that \u201cit would be best to pay for her work out of my own pocket.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time that Reid had mixed family and politics -- or potentially run afoul of ethics rules.\n\nHarry Reid has spent more than 40 years in government, starting as a small city\u2019s attorney and eventually becoming the most powerful senator in the country. He has raised tens of millions of dollars in political contributions, established himself as an institution in Nevada politics along the way, and made himself a very wealthy man. His humble roots -- from growing up in a remote desert town to working six days a week as a Capitol police officer while in law school -- are legend in Washington and Nevada. Reid exhibits the toughness of a once destitute boy who completely transformed his life through determination, hard work -- and good luck.\n\nSome who have watched Reid closely over the years, however, say that his political and economic ascendance has made him increasingly willing to use his power (and apparent electoral resilience) in ways that appear unsavory or nepotistic. The jewelry purchases are only the latest example.\n\nDavid Damore -- a University of Nevada, Las Vegas professor whose research focuses on Silver State politics -- has closely followed Reid for years. He said that the balance between helping family and constituents is a common tension for powerful politicians. \u201cI\u2019m going to put this politely: Their personal interests, they seem to see, represent the common good. They don\u2019t differentiate those two.\u201d\n\nAnother longtime Reid-watcher believes that the latest string of incidents, stretching over the last decade, is just a result of more coverage of Reid -- and not a product of him changing his style.\n\n\u201cAs he\u2019s become more known and a much higher dollar target for his critics, anything he does to assist his family now pegs on the radar,\u201d said John L. Smith, a columnist who has written about Nevada politics for nearly as long as Reid has been in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed his personal method of operation throughout his whole career.\u201d\n\nSmith added, \u201cI can\u2019t see him ever denying his family a break or an opportunity if he could provide it. I guess that\u2019s just part of being a dad and a guy with a certain level of influence.\u201d\n\nNowhere is Reid\u2019s influence more profound than in his home state, where he has built a dizzying network of mutually beneficial political, personal, and business alliances. These associations benefit Reid, his family, his close friends, and, very often, the state that he loves. The sphere of influence took decades to create.\n\nAfter returning from law school at the George Washington University, Reid was hired as city attorney in Henderson (the southern Nevada city where he had attended high school and met his wife, Landra). In 1966, he ran for a position on a local hospital\u2019s board of trustees after, he recalled, being taken aback at the chairman of the board\u2019s rudeness.\n\nHe won the election and two years later sought a promotion to the Nevada Assembly. While in the Assembly, Reid further developed relationships with important players in state politics and began honing his image as a strong consumer advocate. After two busy years introducing a record number of bills, Nevadans elected Reid to be their 25th lieutenant governor. (He ran on a ticket with Mike O\u2019Callaghan, a close friend and mentor.)\n\nAt 31, the boy who had grown up in an alcoholic miner\u2019s cabin stood just a heartbeat away from becoming his state\u2019s most powerful politician. But Reid felt he could achieve even more.\n\nHe ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1974 but narrowly lost, despite the wide expectation that he would win. Reid later told The New Yorker, \u201cEverything was in my favor. But I was young and impulsive and I attacked everybody.\u201d A year later, he ran for mayor of Las Vegas and lost again, that time by a much wider margin. Reid collected himself, temporarily abandoning the pursuit of elective office, and worked as a lawyer in Las Vegas.\n\nBut he returned to public life in 1977 when O\u2019Callaghan, still governor, appointed his former second-in-command to be chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission. The job -- seen then as undesirable, difficult, and perhaps dangerous -- further burnished Reid\u2019s reputation as a tough and honorable public servant. While running the Gaming Commission, Reid publicly jousted with mob bosses, tried to choke someone for attempting to bribe him (in front of FBI agents who were filming the sting), and dealt with the aftermath of his wife discovering a bomb attached to the family car.\n\nBy the time he decided to run for a newly created House seat in 1982, Reid had standing as a politician with uniquely strong integrity -- and guts. He had taken on a powerful telephone company as a freshman in the Nevada Assembly, while also sponsoring innovative air pollution legislation. Nevadans also closely associated him with O\u2019Callaghan, by then a popular former governor nurturing a reformist legacy. Reid\u2019s show of strength and resilience during his Gaming Commission tenure rounded out his picaresque political profile. Still relatively young, he spent just two terms in the House before graduating to the Senate in 1987. He has been there ever since.\n\nBut Reid\u2019s political ascent didn\u2019t stop when he arrived at the upper chamber. A savvy behind-the-scenes player, he became Democratic whip in 1999. After alternating between majority whip and minority whip for several years, his caucus elected him minority leader in 2005. Democrats took control of the Senate after the 2006 midterm elections, and Reid has served as majority leader ever since. For most of the past decade, he has been the most powerful lawmaker in the United States Senate. He is also indisputably the most powerful politician in Nevada -- Democratic or Republican.", "BY: Follow @Kredo0\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration is declining to inform Congress about the number of American citizens and troops killed by Iran and its terror proxies, according to a document provided to Congress and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nThe administration was repeatedly asked by Congress to release figures describing how many Americans and Israelis have been killed by Iran\u2019s military and terror activities since the country\u2019s 1979 revolution.\n\nIn a series of on-the-record responses obtained exclusively by the Free Beacon, and provided in written form to Sen.

The index aims to measure aspects of prosperity that typical gross domestic product measurements don\u2019t include, such as entrepreneurship and opportunity, education, and social capital.\n\nRELATED: Measure of prosperity aims to go beyond GDP\n\nThe freedom scores are based on polling data from 2013 indicating citizens\u2019 satisfaction with their nation's handling of civil liberties, freedom of choice, tolerance of ethnic minorities, and tolerance of immigrants. Polling data were provided by Gallup World Poll Service. The index is notable for the way it measures how free people feel, unlike other freedom indices that measure freedom by comparing government policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good report for Obama,\u201d Legatum Institute spokeswoman Cristina Odone told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIn the 2010 report (which relied on data gathered in 2009), the U.S. was ranked ninth in personal freedom, but that ranking has since fallen to 21st, with several countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom passing the U.S.\n\nMORE: Pro-immigration reform right oppose Obama acting unilaterally\n\nThe nation\u2019s overall personal freedom score has declined by 17 percent since 2009, with a 22 percent drop in combined civil liberty and free choice contributing to that decline.\n\nOf the eight categories in the index, personal freedom was America's second lowest performance relative to other countries. The U.S. had its lowest ranking when it came to safety and security (a broad measure of how threatened citizens feel in instances such as walking late at night, or expressing their opinions) \u2014 ranking 31st out of 142 countries.\n\nThe cross-country comparisons in the index should be taken with a grain of salt. The perception of what freedom means in New Zealand, which has the highest personal freedom ranking, may vary from how Americans measure their own personal freedom. But regardless of how the U.S. compares to other countries, there is no denying that Americans felt less free in 2013 after four more years of Obama\u2019s presidency.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\"", "MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 About two months ago, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley made it the mission of his presidential campaign to start a debate over the debates.\n\nHe spent the summer calling for more debates, and calling on others to call for more debates. He printed new campaign signs with a debate slogan (\u201cWe Need Debate\u201d), joined a debate protest outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, and accused the party chair of autocratically devising a \u201crigged\u201d debate system that would benefit Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn Saturday, at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, O\u2019Malley witnessed one of his biggest victories yet: Dozens of attendees rallied the hall into boos and chants for more debates during a speech by the DNC chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. \u201cC\u2019mon, folks. We\u2019re all on the same side,\u201d she said over the noise.\n\nBut when it was his turn to take the podium, O\u2019Malley did not talk about the Democratic debates, or the \u201cWe Need Debate\u201d campaign, or the supporters who helped interrupt Wasserman-Schultz earlier in the day. He gave his standard speech, hitting on his record as governor of Maryland, his 15 \u201cstrategic goals to rebuild the American Dream\u201d \u2014 and only alluded to the issue with a few passing references to the \u201cunanswered\u201d Republican debates.\n\nAfterward, reporters wanted to know: Where was the victory lap!\n\n\u201cLocal democrats and media members were wondering,\u201d one asked, \u201cwhy not make that more of a focal point with the crowd being obviously be so into that message?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley, still polling in the low single-digits, appeared eager to remind his questioner that his campaign is not, in fact, a campaign for more Democratic debates. It is a campaign for president.\n\n\u201cThe theme of my campaign is not about process. It\u2019s about the actions that we need to take to help rebuild the American dream, and make wages go up rather than down,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, standing with a few aides backstage at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s what I focus on wherever I speak. When I jump up on a chair I often will mention that we should be having more debates rather than fewer.\u201d\n\nThe scene at the convention, where five of the six Democratic candidates spoke after Wasserman-Schultz, signaled both the success of O\u2019Malley\u2019s debate over the debates, and the challenge that now poses to his candidacy, having made a matter of \u201cprocess\u201d such a prominent part of his campaign message.\n\nOn Saturday, O\u2019Malley recognized that the debate question will come and go: Wasserman-Schultz, under added pressure from statements against the setup by Nancy Pelosi and the DNC\u2019s two vice chairs, will either add to the six scheduled debates, or she will not. Then, the debates will happen. The first one is next month.\n\nO\u2019Malley, as he put it backstage, plans to keep talking about the questions that comprise the center of his campaign \u2014 questions, he said, that do not involve debates.\n\n\u201cThe center of my campaign is not about a process. It\u2019s about a country. Our country. And what we need to do to create a better life for our kids,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for why he didn\u2019t highlight the debates in his speech on Saturday, O\u2019Malley noted that the convention marked the first time the candidates appeared at the same event in New Hampshire. (Clinton spoke first, followed by O\u2019Malley; Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont; Lincoln Chafee, the former governor and senator from Rhode Island; and Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard Law professor. Jim Webb, another Democratic candidate, did not attend.)\n\n\u201cThe issue of having more debates is certainly an important one,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cAnd certainly the crowd made their opinion known when the chair spoke.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign zeroed in on the debate issue in August, when the DNC released a slate of dates and locations for six debates. Under the current plan, four come before the caucuses and primaries begin \u2014 including one debate in Iowa, home to the first caucuses, and one debate in New Hampshire, home to the first primary. In 2008, as his campaign has pointed out, Democrats held two debates in Iowa before the caucuses, and three in New Hampshire before the primary.\n\nO\u2019Malley argued that the schedule unfairly benefited Clinton, who, at the time, still led Sanders in early-state polling. His campaign\u2019s lawyer has also questioned the legality of the DNC\u2019s so-called \u201cexclusivity clause,\u201d which bars candidates from participating in unsanctioned non-party debates.\n\nAt a DNC meeting last month, with Wasserman-Schultz seated on stage just paces away, O\u2019Malley delivered a speech largely dedicated to attacking the schedule. While the Republicans criticize Democrats at their own debates, O\u2019Malley said, \u201cwe respond\u2026 with crickets, tumbleweeds, a cynical move to delay and limit our own party debates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is totally unprecedented in our party history,\u201d he said. \u201cThis sort of rigged process this has never been attempted before.\u201d\n\nSanders has since joined O\u2019Malley\u2019s effort. And Clinton, who for weeks declined to engage much at all with the issue when asked, said earlier this month that she would be open to more debates. \u201cI have made it clear that if they want to do more, I\u2019m happy to do them,\u201d Clinton said during an appearance on CNN this week.\n\nOn Saturday, speaking with reporters after his speech, O\u2019Malley argued that the party, and all its candidates, would suffer for every Republican debate without a Democratic counterpart. \u201cWy would you turn over the microphone?\u201d he said. \u201cI think most Democrats are pretty upset by it, and the DNC members themselves were never even consulted. This was a one-woman edict.\u201d\n\nAnd what about his campaign, a reporter asked. How was he going to get his numbers up?\n\n\u201cYou got to keep going,\u201d O\u2019Malley replied.", "Earlier today, Associated Press writer Scott Bauer took to Twitter to note some vendors to Gov.

Meanwhile the current Democratic incumbent, undaunted by his infamous description of ISIS as a \u201cjunior varsity team,\u201d is insisting that the intelligence analysts most responsible for fighting ISIS cook their books to make it seem as if we\u2019re winning despite inconvenient facts suggesting otherwise.\n\nThe Daily Beast, in Wednesday\u2019s exclusive story, reported a breaking scandal from within the ranks of intelligence analysts at the U.S. Central Command, ordinarily a highly secretive organization. \u201cMore than 50 intelligence analysts working out of the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command have formally complained that their reports on ISIS and al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria were being inappropriately altered by senior officials \u201d\n\nThis is hot stuff because intelligence analysts are normally an exceptionally closed-mouth bunch, believing that loose lips still sink ships and cost lives. But at Tampa\u2019s Central Command, that responsibility is taken even more seriously since CENTCOM is the war-fighting organization most responsible for carrying the fight to ISIS. The painstaking assessments of its analysts \u2013 about enemy order of battle, areas of concentration and chains of command \u2013 are the raw material of the nation\u2019s information-centered kill chain. When vague intelligence \u201cindicators\u201d are correlated with other data, intuition and shrewd comparisons can produce hard \u201csignatures.\u201d Only then are our pilots and Special Forces ordered into direct action, bringing firepower to destroy those often elusive targets.\n\nWhen you do that kind of thing for a living every day, then your expert evaluation about the success of the fight will naturally command high-level attention \u2013 and possibly even controversy as well. If \u201ckeep your mouth shut,\u201d is a common instinct among intelligence professionals, then a shared professional culture elevates \u201cgetting it right\u201d into a core value. But on those rare occasions when those values come into direct conflict with each other \u2013 that is when history is in the making.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, this is apparently the case now \u2013 and has been for months. Two central command intelligence analysts \u2013 supported by 50 of their colleagues \u2013 took the extraordinary step of signing a formal complaint to the department of defense inspector general, literally a life-or-death career move. They charge that their reports were being politicized to portray \u201cthe terror groups as weaker than the analysts believe they are.\u201d More specifically, \u201cThe analysts have accused senior-level leaders, including the director of intelligence and his deputy in CENTCOM, of changing their analyses to be more in line with the Obama administration\u2019s public contention that the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda is making progress.\u201d\n\nWhat may be even worse is that the pattern of bureaucratic deception has persisted, what one official described as a \u201ccancer\u201d at the highest levels. Against a backdrop of considerably more optimistic public assessments by President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and a host of multi-starred commanders, the central command analysts began their confrontation back in October.\n\nSo what happens when a courageous analyst fulfills his highest professional duty of speaking \u201ctruth to power?\u201d As documented by the Daily Beast, the Empire instinctively strikes back: Pessimistic reports are edited to include more happy talk while truly ominous assessments are short-stopped, contradicted or deep-sixed. An already-Darwinian personnel system with promotions slowed by budget-cuts easily reins in the odd maverick with a raised eyebrow or the chilling question, \u201cAre you really giving the boss what he expects here?\u201d Sometimes an emergency call to HR is made and early retirement options pointedly made clear.\n\nBut is any of that the fault of Barack Obama? Designated apologists like White House spokesman Josh Ernest will reflexively deny any such culpability. But any intelligence officer worth his or her salt knows that generals and presidents get precisely the kind of intelligence they deserve. Decision-making in the hierarchy of the U.S. government is a tightly closed loop that is exquisitely sensitive to every nuance, every shading of encouragement or discouragement. If the boss doesn\u2019t demand the kind of fearless intelligence that confirms or denies his most cherished preferences, then the entire weight of the federal bureaucracy instinctively closes ranks around him.\n\nWhere bad news is cut off, only catastrophe can enter, either a 9/11 or a Pearl Harbor. As Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling classically observed, surprise at Pearl Harbor was \u201csudden, concentrated and dramatic. The failure, however, was cumulative, widespread and rather drearily familiar.\u201d Just like today, from CENTCOM to the West Wing.\n\nA version of this piece previously appeared on Washington Times\n\nGuest columns do not necessarily reflect the views of Accuracy in Media or its staff.", "Seeking to inject some energy into his political campaign and show that the high-profile showdown with Wisconsin labor unions that made him famous has enduring relevance, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker this week laid out the most aggressive anti-union legislative agenda of any candidate in decades.\n\nRight now, organizing new workers into labor unions is challenging but unions that do exist have a number of legal and institutional protections and privileges that make them a force to be reckoned in business negotiations and political campaigns alike. Walker would make it harder to organize new unions, but also substantially change the status of existing unions to give them many fewer legal and financial resources to advance their vision of workers' interests.\n\nWalker's basic dislike of labor unions is pretty par for the course for conservative politicians these days, but Walker has a particular history with labor and a real passion for the cause of union-bashing. As governor, Walker took office in a fairly strong union state and he acted to curb their political power, defying massive protests and a recall vote then surviving a 2014 reelection battle in which he was one of labor's top targets. These battles are the political fire in which Walker's national reputation was forged, and his union reform plan is an effort to take the heat national.\n\nScott Walker's eight point plan\n\nThe plan can be broken down into eight main elements:\n\nThe last two of these are issues that are important to American unions, but the first six really strike at the heart of organized labor's role in American society. In combination, they would create a world in which collective bargaining as we know it does not exist and in which unions' role in lobbying and electioneering is drastically curtailed. Given the long-term structural decline in union membership from about a third of the workforce to ten percent of it (and lower than that in the private sector), this is more or less the world we are heading toward anyway. But Walker's agenda would greatly hasten the process and shut the door on any possibility for a union revival.\n\nWhy does Scott Walker hate unions?\n\nWalker's basic critique of labor unions is not especially unusual for a modern-day Republican Party politician. His view is that unions are creations of intrusive federal labor regulations, and like other conservative politicians he is not a fan of federal labor regulations. He thinks public sector unions increase the cost of government, and that a private sector union's legally established right to serve as the exclusive bargaining agent for an entire class of workers runs \"counter to the spirit of free enterprise and workplace flexibility.\"\n\nBut Walker takes an especially dim view of unions' political role. As Johns Hopkins University political scientist Daniel Schlozman writes in his new book When Movements Anchor Parties, labor unions have a unique role in the Democratic Party and in forging the modern-day liberal coalition.\n\nTo this day, some unions (especially police, fire, and building trades) sometimes endorse some Republican candidates but on the whole labor is an important source of money and a major source of manpower to Democratic campaigns. Labor also participates centrally in many multi-pronged progressive coalitions. Democrats don't always do what unions want \u2014 the Obama administration has often found itself at odds with labor on issues related to trade and K-12 education \u2014 but labor opposition to an administration initiative is one of the only things that can prompt massive congressional defections from Obama's agenda.\n\nWalker repeatedly refers to unions as \"special interests\" and public sector unions (which, these days, account for most union members) as \"big-government special interests.\"\n\nWhere Walker differs from other Republicans is not so much in his view of unions on the merits, but in his view of their centrality to political conflict. Walker sees Ronald Reagan's confrontation with the air traffic controllers' union as an event of world-historical significance. Where some liberals see the nefarious hand of the Koch Brothers as the key reason their own political hopes and dreams are not realized, Walker sees union power as the master key to American politics. Take risky political steps to crush union power as he did in Wisconsin and you'll open the doors to political change. This is, in part, self-serving since it casts his own governorship as consequential in a way that Jeb Bush's was not. But it also gives every appearance of being sincere.\n\nScott Walker has two-level strategy\n\nOne of the planks of this program is really not like the others, namely the proposal that it be made illegal for a labor union to be designated as the exclusive bargaining agent of a given set of workers.\n\nThis is, under current US law, more or less what it means for there to be a labor union. When you say that the pilots at American Airlines or the journalists at Gawker Media or the teachers in Chicago Public Schools are unionized, what you mean is that there is a union that is legally designated to bargain collectively for those classes of workers. No exceptions to the collective bargain and no side-deals allowed. There's a union and the union negotiates the contract.\n\nIf you get rid of that \u2014 as Walker is proposing to do \u2014 everything else becomes more or less irrelevant.\n\nSo you can think of the other planks as something like a backup strategy. If Walker isn't able to make collective bargaining impossible altogether, he wants to make it harder for unions to win organizing elections, harder to use the contract process to obtain funds, and harder to use funds for political purposes. If necessary, he will specifically try to curb public sector unions and be more lenient to private sector ones.\n\nBut his overarching vision is of an America where there is no collective bargaining. Workers may form clubs of some kind that they might or might not choose to refer to as labor unions, but they would not perform the core bargaining function of a union as we understand it.\n\nScott Walker wants laxer enforcement of existing labor law\n\nOne of Walker's more dramatic-sounding proposals is that he wants to entirely eliminate the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which currently enforces many aspects of labor law, and devolve its functions to the National Mediation Board (which mostly handles airline disputes) and the judiciary.\n\nThis, he says, is because the NLRB \"has become a one-sided advocate for big labor special interests.\"\n\nIn reality, the NLRB is composed of presidential appointees so its attitude tends to swing according to the prevailing winds in the White House. Under Barack Obama the NLRB has acted as a fairly loyal ally of labor and shifting its powers to the judiciary would produce a less union-friendly outcome. But a Scott Walker administration could easily achieve this by appointing union-hostile NLRB members rather than going through the trouble of changing the law.\n\nA national right-to-work law would cost unions money\n\nA little bit confusingly, right-to-work (RTW) laws do not establish a right to work. Instead, they prohibit certain kinds of contractual arrangements between employers and employees at unionized workplaces. It's easier to understand what RTW does if you first look at how things typically work in a unionized private-sector workplace in a non-RTW state.\n\nFirst, you have to start a labor union and get it recognized as the bargaining agent for a specific class of workers. Then once the union is in place, it has to negotiate a first contract with the employer. In almost every case, one provision of that contract is going to be that every worker in the bargaining unit needs to either join the union (and pay dues) or else pay a \"representation fee\" to the union \u2014 the idea being that since all workers in the bargaining unit benefit from the contract's gains for workers, all should contribute to the union's work.\n\nIn an RTW state, these representation fee agreements are illegal. You can join the union and pay dues, or you can stay out of the union and keep your money.\n\nNaturally, some people are going to avail themselves of this option thus significantly reducing the revenue available to the union. However, while right-to-work laws are in place in about half of American states they coexist with the federal rules governing the idea of a union as an exclusive bargaining agent. Walker wants to scrap this rule, which would drastically change the context for RTW laws and possibly render them irrelevant.\n\nRepealing Davis-Bacon would make construction projects cheaper\n\nThe \"Davis-Bacon\" rule is a law dating from the 1930s that requires workers on federally funded construction projects to be paid the local \"prevailing wage\" for a person in their line of work. A contractor cannot, in other words, bring workers in from a lower-wage region or undercut other bidders by employing non-union workers in a heavily unionized region. By the same token, even in a severe recession the government cannot scoop up a bunch of people off the unemployment rolls at low wages.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that repealing this rule would save the federal government about $12 billion over ten years. Alternatively, spending could stay flat and the federal government could undertake somewhat more projects at a somewhat lower per-project rate.\n\nAn attack on unions this drastic is politically risky\n\nRepublicans have advanced union-unfriendly measures for years, typically in a somewhat subtle way working through regulatory and judicial channels and chipping away at ancillary aspects of union power. With union membership steadily dropping as a share of the economy, time appears to be on the side of anti-union forces and it does not seem obviously important to take dramatic, highly visible actions.\n\nWalker's program, however, is so sweeping as to essentially just be asking the question of whether or not there should be any labor unions at all. Americans' answer to this question is pretty consistently yes, so there is some risk in taking this approach.\n\nOf course, union leaders will inevitably support Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders) against any plausible Republican nominee so simply going for the death blow makes a certain amount of sense. On the other hand, unions have traditionally had an imperfect ability to deliver the votes of their own members \u2014 in 2012, 40 percent of residents of union households voted for Mitt Romney \u2014 and Walker could be putting their support at risk.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

There is a segment of the population today that hates America, its people, and the nation\u2019s founding document, but instead of packing up and leaving the country, they have tasked Republicans to punish the entire population by legislating that all Americans suffer their lifestyle founded on poverty, bigotry, ill-health, and religious ignorance. Although there are Americans who hate this nation across the country, it is the former Confederacy that is punishing the people because they failed in their attempt to destroy America of their rejection of the United States Constitution they claim to love.\n\nSouthern states are still resentful they were unable to rip America apart because the Constitution forbade them from keeping dark-skinned human beings as livestock, so they spent the past 149 years punishing different groups of Americans based on their religion\u2019s instruction manual (Christian bible). Over the past thirty years, angry southerners began electing Republicans to strip everything from the people until they relented to a government by bible that drove their attempt to restrict other Americans from their Constitutional freedoms. Republicans have happily accommodated southerners to bring down the rest of the nation to their level of poverty and distress that southern red state voters embrace so long as they have imaginary enemies who believe Americans deserve more than slave wages, sickness, dire poverty, prayer, and firearms.\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge the former Confederacy considered owning human beings a biblically-supported and constitutional right according to their interpretation of the 10th Amendment. But even after losing the Civil War they persisted in targeting other groups for discrimination with biblical justification. Since their war against America, southern states opposed interracial marriage, women\u2019s right to vote, civil rights, voting rights, women\u2019s right to choose their reproductive health, and recently gay rights. The impetus for their opposition to those rights guaranteed in the Constitution is founded in their religion and since they were prohibited by the Constitution from depriving those groups of their rights, they have taken out their anger on the rest of the population by electing Republicans to Congress who promise to subject every American to conditions red southern state residents live under including poverty, slave wages, sickness and disease, and no hope of ever escaping their chosen lifestyle.\n\nIt is difficult for reasonable Americans to comprehend why voters in the South continue electing Republicans that campaign on perpetuating living conditions most Americans consider unacceptable. It is not because they believe all Americans live in poverty and love it, or that they are unaware their miserable plight is unavoidable. Most likely they are willing to live in poverty and ill-health with no chance of escaping because they are angry the rest of the nation will not tolerate their bigotry and hate; their only recourse is electing Republicans to legislate America into one big red state mired in bigotry, religion, guns, and deep poverty.\n\nAccording to The Department of Agriculture\u2019s measure of poverty, every red state from Arizona to South Carolina has the highest poverty rates in America; between 17.9% and 22.8%. The so-called bible belt is America\u2019s poverty belt including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, nearly one in four children trapped in Southern red states live in dire poverty and parents of those children elect Republicans to make those despicable statistics uniform across America. Part and parcel of conditions driving the South\u2019s poverty is low wages that voters elect Republicans to perpetuate across America.\n\nSouthern states are hostile to organized labor, five states have no state minimum wage, most are \u201cright to work for less\u201d states, and the 10 states with the lowest average incomes are in the former Confederacy including Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma according to the Equality of Economic Opportunity Project. Republicans in Congress promote policies that create poverty across the South and red state voters elect them anyway to subject the entire nation to low wages and the poverty they engender.\n\nThe depth of Southern voters\u2019 hatred for other Americans and their own families is evident in their support for Republicans that rejected expanding Medicaid in most of the South. According to a map by the Urban Institute, counties with the most people without healthcare insurance are in the Southern United States and it defies comprehension why voters support Republicans who prevent their children, parents, brothers and sisters from access to healthcare that does not cost states one cent for the first few years and only 10% (at most) thereafter. The same voters avidly oppose the Affordable Care Act that reveals they want tens-of-millions of Americans to suffer the same ill-health and disease they choose for their families.\n\nIt is unfathomable that residents in southern red states reject attempts to help them climb out of poverty and sickness, but religion and guns are powerful motivators for people still holding a grudge over being prevented from owning slaves, restricting women\u2019s rights, and discriminating against Americans according to their religious beliefs. It is no coincidence that the poorest Southern states are also the most religious and have the most firearm violence. In fact, the poorest states have the highest incidence of gun violence to go along with some of the highest gun ownership rates that Republicans take advantage of by joining the National Rifle Association fear mongering that President Obama is coming after their guns as fervently as he is coming after their religious liberty.\n\nMany pundits assert the conditions in southern red states are the fault of Republican-dominated legislatures, but without voters electing Republicans and teabaggers to preserve the deplorable conditions southern states would not lead the nation in poverty. Unfortunately, the same people electing Republicans at the state level vote for Republicans in Congress because they promise to oppose Democrats and President Obama\u2019s campaign to disarm Southern state residents\u2019 of their guns and bibles. It is certain that if President Obama and Democrats supported religious-driven bigotry and gun fanaticism, red southern state voters would reciprocate and support policies giving them decent wages, healthcare, and domestic programs to combat poverty. However, since that will never happen they will vote to elect Republicans to Congress to impose their deplorable living conditions on the entire population and spread their real America to every state in the Union.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

They're measured at the very least in quarters. Back in the 1960s during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, they were typically measured in months. Using a quarters-based metric, the economic expansion has not been continuous, and the press needs to stop pretending that it has been. The economy shrank at an annualized rate of 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 2011, and contracted by 0.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014.

There is reason to believe that the government has made the benchmarks for what qualifies as \"looking for work\" tougher since Dear Leader took office. If as few as 5 million of that group of 94 million is genuinely looking for work, the reported unemployment rate should really be about 8.0 percent instead of 5.1 percent. Maybe the administration is fooling the American people, but it's not fooling Janet Yellen.

Meanwhile, inventories are bloated.\n\nIn addition to the jobs write down noted above, August's reported seasonally adjusted increase of 173,000 payroll jobs was far weaker than expected. Based on the raw, not seasonally adjusted data, even that 173K number looked like an overstatement of true job-market conditions.\n\nThe growth in consumer spending and consumption in general have been unimpressive, despite being heavily propped up by (initially) pain-free borrowing (student loans, car loans) and welfare state subsidies (food stamps, Obamacare subsidies).\n\nAs noted earlier today, thanks to Obama-era economic policies, real median household income, which declined by 8.3 percent during and shortly after the recession, is still 6.5 percent below its pre-recession peak.\n\nAlso noted earlier today, again thanks to Obama-era economic policies, the official poverty rate is still more than 2 percentage points higher than it was before the recession.

There is a segment of the population today that hates America, its people, and the nation\u2019s founding document, but instead of packing up and leaving the country, they have tasked Republicans to punish the entire population by legislating that all Americans suffer their lifestyle founded on poverty, bigotry, ill-health, and religious ignorance. Although there are Americans who hate this nation across the country, it is the former Confederacy that is punishing the people because they failed in their attempt to destroy America of their rejection of the United States Constitution they claim to love.\n\nSouthern states are still resentful they were unable to rip America apart because the Constitution forbade them from keeping dark-skinned human beings as livestock, so they spent the past 149 years punishing different groups of Americans based on their religion\u2019s instruction manual (Christian bible). Over the past thirty years, angry southerners began electing Republicans to strip everything from the people until they relented to a government by bible that drove their attempt to restrict other Americans from their Constitutional freedoms. Republicans have happily accommodated southerners to bring down the rest of the nation to their level of poverty and distress that southern red state voters embrace so long as they have imaginary enemies who believe Americans deserve more than slave wages, sickness, dire poverty, prayer, and firearms.\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge the former Confederacy considered owning human beings a biblically-supported and constitutional right according to their interpretation of the 10th Amendment. But even after losing the Civil War they persisted in targeting other groups for discrimination with biblical justification. Since their war against America, southern states opposed interracial marriage, women\u2019s right to vote, civil rights, voting rights, women\u2019s right to choose their reproductive health, and recently gay rights. The impetus for their opposition to those rights guaranteed in the Constitution is founded in their religion and since they were prohibited by the Constitution from depriving those groups of their rights, they have taken out their anger on the rest of the population by electing Republicans to Congress who promise to subject every American to conditions red southern state residents live under including poverty, slave wages, sickness and disease, and no hope of ever escaping their chosen lifestyle.\n\nIt is difficult for reasonable Americans to comprehend why voters in the South continue electing Republicans that campaign on perpetuating living conditions most Americans consider unacceptable. It is not because they believe all Americans live in poverty and love it, or that they are unaware their miserable plight is unavoidable. Most likely they are willing to live in poverty and ill-health with no chance of escaping because they are angry the rest of the nation will not tolerate their bigotry and hate; their only recourse is electing Republicans to legislate America into one big red state mired in bigotry, religion, guns, and deep poverty.\n\nAccording to The Department of Agriculture\u2019s measure of poverty, every red state from Arizona to South Carolina has the highest poverty rates in America; between 17.9% and 22.8%. The so-called bible belt is America\u2019s poverty belt including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, nearly one in four children trapped in Southern red states live in dire poverty and parents of those children elect Republicans to make those despicable statistics uniform across America. Part and parcel of conditions driving the South\u2019s poverty is low wages that voters elect Republicans to perpetuate across America.\n\nSouthern states are hostile to organized labor, five states have no state minimum wage, most are \u201cright to work for less\u201d states, and the 10 states with the lowest average incomes are in the former Confederacy including Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma according to the Equality of Economic Opportunity Project. Republicans in Congress promote policies that create poverty across the South and red state voters elect them anyway to subject the entire nation to low wages and the poverty they engender.\n\nThe depth of Southern voters\u2019 hatred for other Americans and their own families is evident in their support for Republicans that rejected expanding Medicaid in most of the South. According to a map by the Urban Institute, counties with the most people without healthcare insurance are in the Southern United States and it defies comprehension why voters support Republicans who prevent their children, parents, brothers and sisters from access to healthcare that does not cost states one cent for the first few years and only 10% (at most) thereafter. The same voters avidly oppose the Affordable Care Act that reveals they want tens-of-millions of Americans to suffer the same ill-health and disease they choose for their families.\n\nIt is unfathomable that residents in southern red states reject attempts to help them climb out of poverty and sickness, but religion and guns are powerful motivators for people still holding a grudge over being prevented from owning slaves, restricting women\u2019s rights, and discriminating against Americans according to their religious beliefs. It is no coincidence that the poorest Southern states are also the most religious and have the most firearm violence. In fact, the poorest states have the highest incidence of gun violence to go along with some of the highest gun ownership rates that Republicans take advantage of by joining the National Rifle Association fear mongering that President Obama is coming after their guns as fervently as he is coming after their religious liberty.\n\nMany pundits assert the conditions in southern red states are the fault of Republican-dominated legislatures, but without voters electing Republicans and teabaggers to preserve the deplorable conditions southern states would not lead the nation in poverty. Unfortunately, the same people electing Republicans at the state level vote for Republicans in Congress because they promise to oppose Democrats and President Obama\u2019s campaign to disarm Southern state residents\u2019 of their guns and bibles. It is certain that if President Obama and Democrats supported religious-driven bigotry and gun fanaticism, red southern state voters would reciprocate and support policies giving them decent wages, healthcare, and domestic programs to combat poverty. However, since that will never happen they will vote to elect Republicans to Congress to impose their deplorable living conditions on the entire population and spread their real America to every state in the Union.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

All but three of them have been United States senators or state governors at some point in their careers. The other three, according to a Morning Consult poll of people who watched the 11 leading contenders debate this past Wednesday, are leading the race.\n\nA couple of big caveats: this is Morning Consult's first campaign season and it isn't yet a proven pollster, and the people who watched the Republican debates may not represent the party's primary electorate as a whole. But when you consider that this is a poll of Republicans (and independents who plan to vote in Republican primaries) who are engaged enough to watch an early debate \u2014 who one would think are the most engaged voters out there \u2014 it gets even more worrisome for the establishment.\n\nHere are four terrible signs for the GOP establishment in the poll, and one good one:\n\n1) Political n00bs get an outright majority of debate-watchers' support\n\n36 percent of poll respondents support Donald Trump; 12 percent support Ben Carson; and 10 percent support Carly Fiorina. All together, that's 58 percent of Republican debate-watchers who support one of the three candidates in the race with no experience in elected office whatsoever. To put it another way, none of the twelve candidates in the field with political experience managed to crack 10 percent of the vote.\n\n2) Fiorina's rising \u2014 but she's not taking Trump's support\n\nMost observers, including the poll's respondents, agreed Fiorina won the debate. Now, many pundits are portraying her as the new candidate with momentum \u2014 implying that she's seizing it from Trump.\n\nBut Trump not only failed to lose support after a debate where he was largely irrelevant to the proceedings, he actually gained 5 percentage points since the last Morning Connect poll was conducted a week ago. If neither Fiorina's rise nor his own debate performance has hurt Trump, it's getting hard to imagine what can.\n\n3) Jeb Bush's numbers are dismal \u2014 and Scott Walker's are even worse\n\n6 percent of poll respondents said they would vote for Jeb Bush. That ties him with Chris Christie for sixth place (behind Trump, Carson and Fiorina, as well as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio). Just like Trump is somehow still gaining support, Bush is somehow still losing it.\n\nIt is definitely bad news for the Republican establishment that their preferred candidate is getting 6 percent in the polls. But the man who was supposed to be his \"conservative challenger\" is doing even worse. Scott Walker, who when the race started was the closest thing to the candidate of the conservative movement, is polling at 1 percent. He is tied with former New York Governor George Pataki.\n\n4) The highest-polling elected official is Ted Cruz\n\nTed Cruz made his name, nationally, fighting the leadership of his own party in the Senate in the floor fight that resulted in the 2011 government shutdown. Ted Cruz is notoriously disliked by his Republican Senate colleagues. Ted Cruz's strategy over the last few months has been to buddy up with Donald Trump \u2014 even appearing at a rally in DC against the Iran nuclear deal together \u2014 in the hopes that when (or if) Trump's candidacy fades, Cruz will swoop in and take his support. Ted Cruz is, in other words, running against the fact that he is an elected official. Ted Cruz is polling better than all the other elected officials.\n\n5) But what if all of this is just very good news for Marco Rubio?\n\nIf you are an establishment Republican donor, all of this looks pretty dismal to you. But there is hope! After yet another quietly competent debate performance, Marco Rubio \u2014 who was once languishing with Christie and Rand Paul \u2014 is rising in the polls and, according to Morning Connect, right behind Cruz.\n\nRubio is incredibly amenable to conservative establishment preferences. In fact, the biggest problem with his candidacy so far was that some of the people who might support Rubio were instead backing Jeb Bush. In a happy coincidence, just as Bush's campaign is looking hopeless \u2014 and just as it's becoming clear that the anti-establishment candidates aren't going to take each other out on their own \u2014 Rubio's looking a little better. In other words, Marco Rubio has a pretty strong case that if the GOP donor base wants to take down Donald Trump, he, and not Bush, is the candidate they should bet on.", "Treating this stupid media controversy like it deserves to be treated, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump took to Twitter to wrist-flick away the latest bubbled, leftwing mainstream media frenzy.

Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\"", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Rand Paul won the presidential straw poll at this weekend\u2019s Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference, capturing 22 percent of the vote among a field of 16 candidates. (Photo: Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News)\n\nMackinac Island \u2014 Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul won the presidential straw poll at this weekend\u2019s Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference, capturing 22 percent of the vote among a field of 16 candidates.\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina came in second with 15 percent, followed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich in third place with 13.8 percent and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in fourth with 13 percent in The Detroit News/MIRS presidential straw poll.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush finished fifth in the straw poll with 9.7 percent of the 785 registered conference attendees who voted.\n\nThe Paul campaign celebrated the straw poll victory as a sign that the libertarian-minded senator\u2019s presidential bid remains alive, despite registering single-digit numbers in national polls.\n\n\u201cThis is an organization test that indicates that (Paul) will over-perform in other organizational contests such as Iowa, Nevada, Minnesota and other caucus states that come before the March 8 Michigan primary,\u201d said John Yob, Paul\u2019s national political director and a Grand Rapids-based GOP consultant.\n\nThe candidate also welcomed the result.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor to win the MRLC straw poll as it is voted on by the most influential Michigan GOP members, grassroots leaders and party activists from throughout the country\u2026,\u201d Paul said.\n\nThe top five presidential candidates in the straw poll each barnstormed Mackinac Island Friday and Saturday, engaging in retail politicking among 2,200 Michigan Republicans attending the state party\u2019s 31st biennial leadership conference. The top two vote-getters Paul and Fiorina were the last candidates to speak Saturday night at the Grand Hotel.\n\nSteve Mitchell, an East Lansing-based pollster, said the results were probably highly influenced by the Paul campaign bringing supporters to the island.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an effective strategy, and the campaign chooses to make that investment,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey also have supporters who are really true believers in their cause \u2014 people who will come up to the island. They have a record of always turning out the vote in a straw poll.\u201d\n\nPaul also won a straw poll at the 2013 GOP Mackinac conference.\n\nFiorina is likely still benefiting from her recent debate performance Wednesday night at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California., Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cShe is clearly a rising star, and she is the only \u2018she\u2019 in the race, so that\u2019s going to help attract some women,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cShe\u2019s a new face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the exception of Fiorina, the results are almost the inverse relationship to the results of recent polls of likely Republican Party primary voters \u2014 which is sort of fascinating,\u201d Mitchell added.\n\nWendy Day, state director for Cruz\u2019s campaign, downplayed the results late Saturday night, noting her candidate attracted an estimated 400 people to a Saturday morning rally at Mackinac Island\u2019s public school.\n\n\u201cWe had a completely organized showing at this event. We didn\u2019t pay for anybody\u2019s credentials,\u201d Day said. \u201cStraw polls are not always indicative of the actual ground game and the mood on the island.\u201d\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio and billionaire Donald Trump, who both did not attend the conference, trailed behind Bush with 8.4 percent and and 6.8 percent, respectively. Famed neurosurgeon and Detroit native Dr. Ben Carson, who also skipped the conference, finished eighth at 5.5 percent.\n\nGOP leaders, activists and donors attending the two-day convention favored Fiorina for vice president with 30.5 percent of the vote. Rubio finished second in the hypothetical vice presidential voting with 17 percent, followed by Kasich with 9.7 percent.\n\nMichigan Information & Research Service and The Detroit News started conducting the straw poll Friday and ended the survey of conference attendees at 10 p.m. Saturday after Paul delivered the final keynote address of the weekend.\n\nBefore his Saturday night speech, Paul held a rally at the nearby Gate House restaurant that was attended by about 65 students from Hillsdale College and other young Republicans from Saginaw Valley State University, Central Michigan University, Grand Valley State University and the University of Michigan.\n\n\u201cMore than anyone, I think he represents values like liberty, the Constitution and economic freedom,\u201d said Curran Hennessey of Grand Rapids. \u201cHe is in the best position to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Bush campaign sought straw poll votes, Michigan Chairman Bill Schuette, the state\u2019s attorney general, said Thursday the campaign was not \u201cactively campaigning for votes in the straw poll.\u201d\n\nBush had the stage to himself Friday night and said he would work to repair America\u2019s relations abroad and with Canada. The son and brother of two former presidents also sought to portray his family name as an asset, rather than a political liability, after several months of avoiding it.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had to cancel his Saturday morning speech because his charter plane couldn\u2019t land on Mackinac Island during an early morning rain storm. Walker finished ninth in the straw poll with 2.5 percent of the vote.\n\nAt a Saturday luncheon, Cruz and Kasich took turns making their pitches to the GOP faithful.\n\nCruz used his speech to warn against the encroaching size of government, while Kasich spoke in specific terms about how he would rein in the federal bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cIt was a contrast between the entertainer and the serious candidate,\u201d said Republican strategist Greg McNeilly, who is neutral in the presidential race but no fan of Cruz\u2019s candidacy.\n\nNatalie Griffin, a junior at Western Michigan University, said she was voting for Kasich because his views on the issues most closely align with hers, especially prioritizing mental health treatment and prison reform.\n\n\u201cEven on things that I don\u2019t necessarily agree with him on, he\u2019s still a moderate and not an extremist,\u201d said Griffin, who is studying to become a nurse.\n\nBefore filling out her ballot, Kristin Holcomb of Chelsea was wavering between Bush, Kasich and Fiorina.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for Mitt Romney to show up, honestly. But I think I\u2019ll go with Bush because he\u2019s my first \u2018love,\u2019\u201d said Holcomb, who lives half of the year in Florida.\n\n\u201cBut I could be swayed because I like the other two very much.\u201d\n\nMarylouise Fischbach of Grass Lake was leaning toward both Fiorina and Kasich \u2014 \u201cmore so Kasich at this point,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very smart and smart fiscally. He balanced the budget, and we need that,\u201d Fischbach said. \u201cI don\u2019t hold it against him that he went to Ohio State.\u201d\n\nMike Krafchak of Milford said he was voting for Trump, having been a fan since reading his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d when published in 1987.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a businessman, and I know what businessmen can do. I\u2019m looking for something new,\u201d Krafchak said, adding he\u2019s frustrated and disenchanted with the governing elite in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been able to prove he can get things done, over and over and over. I\u2019m very disappointed he\u2019s not here. I would have gone to Traverse City to pick him up.\u201d\n\nJared Maynard, a state GOP committee member from Macomb County, was volunteering for the campaign of Rubio, who did not attend the conference. Maynard said Rubio\u2019s humble roots appeal to his own blue-collar upbringing in Macomb County.\n\n\u201cMarco Rubio is a young guy who\u2019s ready to lead and bring actual leadership when you see him,\u201d Maynard said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1KnYSgq", "This video is unavailable.\n\nSorry about that.", "Published on Jun 23, 2015\n\nSometimes our work takes us into areas that appear to be \"science fiction,\" but under careful analysis the facts rise to the level of science fact and the implication is catastrophic!

Earlier this week, an Italian version of the encyclical was leaked online. There is a lot in the encyclical that is based on highly contentious \u201cscience\u201d regarding global warming, resources and regional development. Catholics should be reminded that the area of competence for a pope with regard to infallibility lies ONLY with those matters pertaining to the salvation of souls, namely faith and morals. Any discussions on the weather, contentious sciences, or concerns regarding economic resource allocation, except where they intersect with faith and morals, are entirely outside the purview of papal competence.\n\nThose matters within the encyclical pertaining to good stewardship and the care for the poor are to be taken with good grace as a loving guidance from our Holy Father, but we are not bound by obedience on any suggestions or recommendations as to how to implement such advice. As such, this is the area (as well as all of the references to contentious scientific matters) where there appears to be some issue.\n\nThe word \u201csustain\u201d (as itself or a part of the word \u201csustainable\u201d) appears in the leaked encyclical a total of 25 times and the word \u201cdevelopment\u201d appears 85 times. \u201cThe phrase \u201csustainable development\u201d appears 8 times and the United Nations appears only once. Now, I am working from a very low quality translation so this analysis will not be definitive, and I do hope to see some changes in the official version. But I\u2019ve decided to release this analysis prior to the official version of the encyclical because I suspect that the encyclical is going to be used as a bludgeon by the United Nations and its allies at Catholic Relief Services, Caritas Internationalis and a host of other Catholic social justice and development organizations to get Catholics anywhere and everywhere on-board with the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nI\u2019ll do an expose on the Sustainable Development Goals at another time, as well as publish a white paper on its predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals, showing wide-spread support from Catholic circles for the MDGs. The white paper on the MDGs, will show that the MDGs were a population-reduction program thinly disguised as a poverty-reduction program. The Sustainable Development Goals, written and guided by the same folks behind the Millennium Development Goals, is an extension of the MDGs \u2026 but more on that in another post.\n\nThe leaked encyclical\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csustainable development\u201d is troubling at best. Even if it isn\u2019t Pope Francis\u2019 intent to gather support for the Sustainable Development Goals, it\u2019s a solid bet that Catholic social justice agencies will use the Pope\u2019s words to ramp-up support for the SDGs. And that\u2019s a problem.\n\nBack in January of 2014, Pope Francis announced his intention to publish an encyclical on \u201chuman ecology.\u201d In May of 2014, the United Nations\u2019 climate chief, Christina Figures, said that the UN will back a letter by the pope on man\u2019s relationship with the environment. This is particularly troubling because it illustrates a tight connection between the United Nations and the encyclical in question.\n\nIn May of 2014, the UNFPA (the United Nations Population Fund) produced a document titled, \u201cRELIGION AND DEVELOPMENT POST-2015\u201d. On page 20 of the document is a section on the Sustainable Development Goals, and after explaining that the Sustainable Development Goals \u201cbalance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the environmental, social and economic,\u201d page 21 says the following:\n\n\u201cAppreciation of these issues is growing within the UN, as evidenced for example in the May 2014 meeting between the UN leadership and representatives of the Vatican and His Holiness the Pope on the SDG agenda. This meeting was followed by an audience between the UN Secretary-General and His Holiness, who committed the Catholic Church to support the SDG efforts.\u201d\n\nSo, according to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Pope Francis agreed, just months after announcing his intent to write an encyclical on \u201chuman ecology\u201d to \u201ccommit the Catholic Church to support the SDG efforts.\u201d This is not an inconsequential statement. The entire section in context is as follows. Pay particular attention to the portions that have been bolded and underlined:\n\nThe SDGs\n\n\u201cTo truly listen is to risk being changed forever.\u201d \u2014Northrup Frye\n\nThe concept of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was born at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, Rio+20, in 2012. The objective was to produce a set of universally applicable goals that balances the three dimensions of sustainable development: the environmental, social and economic. At this particular moment, the post-2015 and SDG processes are moving towards their conclusion, with issues important and relevant for all development actors. Our consultation in May 2014 was particularly timely, as each of the post-2015 agenda items critically intersect with religious traditions, with values, and with what humanity as a whole has been grappling with for millennia. The MDGs were a social agenda, but this is being greatly expanded into a radically different universal agenda that is not just about \u2018poor people\u2019, and is not just decided on in capitals. In fact, all are expected to take action, everywhere.\n\nThe Rio+20 conference emphasized that governments themselves want to be in the drivers\u2019 seat, instead of the development agenda being fashioned at the level of technocrats. This heightens the importance of an intergovernmental process complemented by an active series of dialogues and engagements with civil society organizations. A global conversation is evolving, involving 2.4 million people so far, through the \u2018World We Want\u2019 initiative (www.worldwewant2015.org). The conversations underline, clearly and unequivocally, that people around the world know precisely what kind of world they want to live in.\n\nThe post-2015 engagements to date, particularly with the results of the global conversations, simultaneously validate and yet are very different from the Millennium Development Goals. The top issues identified correspond to MDG articulations, with education appearing as the number one need, followed by access to education and quality health care for all. But in addition, there is a significant percentage of those who identified \u2018honest and responsive government\u2019 at a par with those who noted \u2018access to decent jobs\u2019; both areas were absent from the MDGs. These priorities were closely followed by food security, gender quality and freedom from fear and violence; also not included in the MDGs. It is important to note that while many identified needs are missing from the MDGs themselves, they nevertheless resonate strongly with the Millennium Declaration.\n\nAll of these needs are precisely what religions and other faith traditions grapple with. Faith is arguably the terrain where justice, peace and the struggle against inequality interface. This meeting is therefore an opportunity to consider how religious actors may be shaping or impacting upon the emerging agendas of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Appreciation of these issues is growing within the UN, as evidenced for example in the May 2014 meeting between the UN leadership and representatives of the Vatican and His Holiness the Pope on the SDG agenda. This meeting was followed by an audience between the UN Secretary-General and His Holiness, who committed the Catholic Church to support the SDG efforts. This entire meeting was remarkable.\n\nIn reading the context of this entire section of the UNFPA document on the Sustainable Development Goals, it is very clear that the intention of the United Nations is to use religions as a vehicle for selling the world its bill of goods. In paragraph 169 of the encyclical (below), the pope refers to the Sustainable Development Goals and the Rio+20 conference as facing difficulties because individual nations tend to serve their own interests over global interests. In the last sentence of that paragraph, the pope hopes and prays for \u201cpositive developments of the current discussions\u201d in order to avoid \u201cimprudent delay.\u201d It seems clear that the delay is a reference to adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, without saying so outright.\n\n169. With regard to care for biological diversity and desertification, progress has been much less significant. With regard to climate change, progress is woefully sketchy. The reduction of greenhouse gases requires honesty, courage and responsibility, especially by the most powerful countries and the most polluting. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, known as Rio + 20 (Rio de Janeiro 2012), issued wide as ineffective Final Declaration. International negotiations may not advance significantly because of the positions of the countries that favor their national interests than the global common good. How many will suffer the consequences that we try to cover up, remember this lack of awareness and responsibility. As he was elaborating this encyclical, the debate has taken on a special intensity. We believe we can only pray to God for the positive developments of the current discussions, so that future generations do not suffer the consequences of imprudent delay.\n\nAgain, this is a very low-quality translation, but the positive impression of the Sustainable Development Goals is evident, and what we are reading is quite possibly a clear endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals themselves. It certainly is no accident that Ban Ki Moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, and his architect of the Millennium Development Goals, Jeffrey Sachs (also a major proponent of population control), met with Pope Francis regarding the environment prior to the release of this encyclical; an encyclical whose leaked version contains supportive reference to the United Nations. It\u2019s also not coincidental that Carolyn Woo, the president and CEO of Catholic Relief Services, will speak at and be present for the official release of the encyclical as well. Also speaking at the release of the encyclical is the anti-Catholic, population-control promoting atheist, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, who is said to have helped draft the encyclical itself.\n\nIt is a reasonable conclusion that this encyclical (whether intended by Pope Francis or not) is going to be paraded around in order to get as many Catholic organizations as possible to support, promote and participate in the Sustainable Development Goals. And since Caritas Internationalis has already given full, unconditional support for the Millennium Development Goals (the predecessor of the Sustainable Development Goals), it\u2019s safe to say that we will VERY quickly see CRS and other major Caritas affiliates, and other Catholic social justice organizations immediately take the encyclical and use it as a bludgeon to tell Catholics that they have an obligation to participate in and support the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nLet\u2019s hope and pray that the official version being released this Thursday does not have the references to the United Nation\u2019s agenda that the leaked version has. And let us fast and pray for the Holy Father. Whether he knows it or not, the United Nations is going to do its best to use our Pope and his encyclical against the faithful.", "What is Real Estate For Life?\n\nReal Estate for Life donates vital funding to pro-life organizations through agent referrals at absolutely no cost to you.

Well, like anyone else, they would do it for self-interest. And what would their self-interest be? We all know the top two answers to that question: 1. a Palestinian state and 2. the advancement of Islam in America. The idea then was to advance blacks who would facilitate these two goals to positions of power in the Federal government, preferably, of course, the Presidency. And why would the Arabs target blacks in particular for this job? Well, for the same reason the early communists chose them as their vanguard for revolution (which literally means \u201cchange\u201d) in America. Allow me to quote Trotsky, in 1939: \u201cThe American Negroes, for centuries the most oppressed section of American society and the most discriminated against, are potentially the most revolutionary element of the population. They are designated by their historical past to be, under adequate leadership, the very vanguard of the proletarian revolution.\u201d Substitute the word \u201cIslam\u201d for the words \u201cthe proletarian revolution,\u201d and you most clearly get the picture, as Islam is a revolutionary movement just like communism is. (Trivia: it is from this very quote that Van Jones takes his name. Van is short for vanguard. He was born \u201cAnthony\u201d). In addition, long before 1979, blacks had become the vanguard of the spread of Islam in America, especially in prisons.\n\nInterestingly, in context with the fact that this article was written by her father-in-law, Valerie Jarrett has an unusual amount of influence over Obama (along with personal security that may be even better than the President\u2019s, another unusual and intriguing bit of business here). And equally interesting is that Obama, who may have been a beneficiary of this Muslim money, and may now be in this Muslim debt, has aggressively pursued both of the Muslim agendas I cited above. And, also equally interesting, is that Obama has paid a king\u2019s ransom for court ordered seals of any such records of this potential financing of his college education, and perhaps, of other of his expenses.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s very important to note that the main source for the article is Khalid Mansour, \u201cthe same lawyer who allegedly helped arrange for the entrance of Barack Obama into Harvard Law School in 1988.\u201d (Valerie Jarrett, by the way, was born in Iran. The one country protected by Obama from the sweep of the Arab Spring.) Now all of this may seem sensational, but let\u2019s face facts. What makes it most disturbing is that not only is it all logical, but it suddenly makes a lot of previously confusing things make perfect sense. \u2013 Pat Dollard\n\nExcerpted from Daily Interlake: Searching old newspapers is one of my favorite pastimes, and I have tried to use them many times to shed light on current events \u2014 or to inform readers about how the past is prologue to our very interesting present-day quandaries.\n\nRecently, I came across a syndicated column from November 1979 that seemed to point 30 years into the future toward an obscure campaign issue that arose briefly in the 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThough by no means definitive, it provides an interesting insight, at least, into how Chicago politics intersected with the black power movement and Middle Eastern money at a certain point in time. Whether it has any greater relevance to the 2012 presidential campaign, I will allow the reader to decide. In order to accomplish that, I will also take the unusual step of providing footnotes and the end of this column so that each of you can do the investigative work for yourself.\n\nThe column itself had appeared in the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Evening Independent of Nov. 6, but it was the work of a veteran newspaperman who at the time was working for the prestigious Chicago Tribune and whose work was syndicated nationally. (1)\n\nSo far as I know, this 1979 column has not previously been brought to light, but it certainly should be because it broke some very interesting news about the \u201crumored billions of dollars the oil-rich Arab nations are supposed to unload on American black leaders and minority institutions.\u201d The columnist quoted a black San Francisco lawyer who said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a rumor. Aid will come from some of the Arab states.\u201d\n\nWell, if anyone would know, it would have been this lawyer \u2014 Donald Warden, who had helped defend OPEC in an antitrust suit that year and had developed significant ties with the Saudi royal family since becoming a Muslim and taking the name Khalid Abdullah Tariq al-Mansour.\n\nAl-Mansour told Jarrett that he had presented the \u201cproposed special aid program to OPEC Secretary-General Rene Ortiz\u201d in September 1979, and that \u201cthe first indications of Arab help to American blacks may be announced in December.\u201d Maybe so, but I looked high and wide in newspapers in 1979 and 1980 for any other stories about this aid package funded by OPEC and never found it verified. (Continued)\n\nYou would think that a program to spend \u201c$20 million per year for 10 years to aid 10,000 minority students each year, including blacks, Arabs, Hispanics, Asians and native Americans\u201d would be referred to somewhere other than one obscure 1979 column, but I haven\u2019t found any other word of it.\n\nMaybe the funding materialized, maybe it didn\u2019t, but what\u2019s particularly noteworthy is that this black Islamic lawyer who \u201cfor several years [had] urged the rich Arab kingdoms to cultivate stronger ties to America\u2019s blacks by supporting black businesses and black colleges and giving financial help to disadvantaged students\u201d was also the same lawyer who allegedly helped arrange for the entrance of Barack Obama into Harvard Law School in 1988.\n\nThat tale had surfaced in 2008 when Barack Obama was a candidate for president and one of the leading black politicians in the country \u2014 Percy Sutton of New York \u2014 told an interviewer on a Manhattan TV news show that he had been introduced to Obama \u201cby a friend who was raising money for him. The friend\u2019s name is Dr. Khalid al-Mansour, from Texas. He is the principal adviser to one of the world\u2019s richest men. He told me about Obama.\u201d (2)\n\nThis peculiar revelation engendered a small hubbub in 2008, but was quickly dismissed by the Obama campaign as the ditherings of a senile old man. I don\u2019t believe President Obama himself ever denied the story personally, and no one has explained how Sutton came up with this elaborate story about Khalid al-Mansour if it had no basis in fact, and in any case al-Mansour no longer denies it. (3)\n\nBack in 2008, while actually supporting Hillary Clinton in the New York primary, Percy Sutton was interviewed on TV and said that he thought Barack Obama was nonetheless quite impressive. He also revealed that he had first heard about Obama 20 years previously in a letter where al-Mansour wrote, \u201cthere is a young man that has applied to Harvard. I know that you have a few friends up there because you used to go up there to speak. Would you please write a letter in support of him?\u201d\n\nSutton concluded in the interview, \u201cI wrote a letter of support of him to my friends at Harvard, saying to them I thought there was a genius that was going to be available and I certainly hoped they would treat him kindly.\u201d\n\nUntil now, there really has been no context within which to understand the Sutton story or to buttress it as a reliable account other than the reputation of Sutton himself as one of the top leaders of the black community in Manhattan \u2014 himself a noted attorney, businessman and politician. But the new discovery of the 1979 column that established Khalid al-Mansour\u2019s interest in creating a fund to give \u201cfinancial help to disadvantaged students\u201d does provide a clue that he might indeed \u2014 along with his patron, Arab Prince Alwaleed bin Talal \u2014 have taken an interest in the \u201cgenius\u201d Barack Obama.\n\nIt also might be considered more than coincidence that the author of that 1979 newspaper column was from Chicago, where Barack Obama settled in 1986 a few years after his stint at Columbia University. It is certainly surprising that the author of that column was none other than Vernon Jarrett, the future (and later former) father-in-law of Valerie Jarrett, who ultimately became the consigliatore of the Obama White House.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that Vernon Jarrett was one of the best friends and a colleague of Frank Marshall Davis, the former Chicago journalist and lifelong communist who moved to Hawaii in the late 1940s and years later befriended Stanley and Madelyn Dunham and their daughter Stanley Ann, the mother of Barack Obama. (4)\n\nAnd to anyone who has the modicum of a spark of curiosity, it is surely intriguing that Frank Davis took an active role in the rearing of young Barack from the age of 10 until he turned 18 and left Hawaii for his first year of college at Occidental College in Los Angeles. (5)\n\nIt is also at least suggestive that Obama began that college education as a member of the highly international student body of Occidental College in 1979, the same year when Vernon Jarrett was touting the college aid program being funded by OPEC and possibly Prince Alwaleed. The fact that President Obama has studiously avoided releasing records of his college years is suggestive also, but has no evidentiary value in the present discussion. (6)\n\nThe nature of Vernon Jarrett\u2019s relationship to Khalid al-Mansour is likewise uncertain, but it is very likely they had known each other as leaders of the black civil-rights movement for many years. Under his previous name of Donald Warden, al-Mansour had founded the African American Association in the Bay Area in the early 1960s. He had also helped inspire the Black Panther Party through his association with black-power leaders such as Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. Seale, of course, had a famous association with Chicago later, when he was part of the Chicago Eight charged with conspiracy and inciting to riot at the Democratic National Convention in 1968. (7)\n\nIn any case, it doesn\u2019t matter if Vernon Jarrett and Khalid al-Mansour had a personal relationship or not. For some reason, al-Mansour had used Jarrett as the messenger to get out the word about his efforts to funnel Arab oil money to black students and minority colleges at about the same time that Barack Obama began his college career. That doesn\u2019t mean either Jarrett or al-Mansour knew Obama at that time, but eight years later when Obama was a rising star in Chicago, a friend of Bill Ayers and Valerie Jarrett, it is much more likely that he did indeed have the assistance of very important people in his meteoric rise. The words of Percy Sutton about what al-Mansour told him regarding Obama certainly have the ring of truth:\n\n\u201cHis introduction was there is a young man that has applied to Harvard. I know that you have a few friends back there\u2026 Would you please write a letter in support of him? (That\u2019s before Obama decided to run.) \u2026 and he interjected the advice that Obama had passed the requirements, had taken and passed the requirements necessary to get into Harvard and become president of the Law Review. That\u2019s before he ever ran for anything. And I wrote a letter in support of him to my friends at Harvard, saying to them that I thought there was a genius that was going to be available and I certainly hoped they would treat him kindly\u2026\u201d (2)\n\nWhat possible significance could all this have? We may never know, but Vernon Jarrett, back in 1979, thought that OPEC\u2019s intention to fund black and minority education would have huge political ramifications. As Jarrett wrote:\n\n\u201cThe question of financial aid from the Arabs could raise a few extremely interesting questions both inside and outside the black community. If such contributions are large and sustained, the money angle may become secondary to the sociology and politics of such an occurrence.\u201d (1)\n\nHe was, of course, right.\n\nAs Jarrett suggests, any black institutions and presumably individuals who became beholden to Arab money might be expected to continue the trend of American \u201cnew black advocacy for a homeland for the Palestinians\u201d and presumably for other Islamic and Arabic interests in the Middle East. For that reason, if for no other, the question of how President Obama\u2019s college education was funded is of considerably more than academic interest.\n\nVideo: Percy Sutton on Obama and Khalid Mansour", "", "What is Real Estate For Life?\n\nReal Estate for Life donates vital funding to pro-life organizations through agent referrals at absolutely no cost to you.

General Assembly in New York on Monday, Sept. 29, 2014. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 The Obama administration does not share Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s view that the forces of militant Islam, whether Sunni or Shi\u2019ite, have in common an ultimate goal \u201cto dominate the world,\u201d a State Department spokeswoman said Monday.\n\nIn a hard-hitting speech at the United Nations, the Israeli leader said that entities such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS/ISIL), Hamas, the Iranian regime, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda and Boko Haram share that eventual goal.\n\nJen Psaki was asked at the State Department daily briefing later whether the administration agreed with Netanyahu\u2019s argument that those various groups \u201care all part of the same kind of militant Muslim \u2013 Islamic attempt to rule the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would not agree with that characterization, no,\u201d she replied.\n\nAsked about Netanyahu\u2019s specific correlation of ISIS and Hamas, Psaki said that while both were U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, ISIS \u201cposes a different threat to Western interests and to the United States. And that\u2019s just a fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu or anyone else from Israel is suggesting that the United States launch a military campaign against Hamas, so we certainly \u2013 they are both designated terrorist organizations under the United States designations, but certainly we see differences in terms of the threat and otherwise.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Netanyahu said, \u201cYou know the famous American saying, \u2018All politics is local.\u2019 For the militant Islamists, \u2018All politics is global.\u2019 Because their ultimate goal is to dominate the world.\u201d\n\nHe said many of the countries supporting the effort against ISIS now, opposed Israel for confronting Hamas just weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThey evidently don\u2019t understand that ISIS and Hamas are branches of the same poisonous tree,\u201d he said. \u201cISIS and Hamas share a fanatical creed, which they both seek to impose well beyond the territory under their control.\u201d\n\nBeyond Hamas\u2019 immediate goal to destroy Israel, as laid out in its charter, Netanyahu said, it\u2019s broader objective was also the creation of a caliphate.\n\n\u201cHamas shares the global ambitions of its fellow militant Islamists. That\u2019s why its supporters wildly cheered in the streets of Gaza as thousands of Americans were murdered on 9/11. And that\u2019s why its leaders condemned the United States for killing Osama bin Laden, whom they praised as a holy warrior. So when it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that both ISIS and Hamas also had in common what \u201call militant Islamists share in common,\u201d whether al-Qaeda and its various affiliates, Boko Haram in Nigeria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, al-Shabaab in Somalia, al-Nusra in Syria or the Mahdi Army in Iraq.\n\n\u201cSome are radical Sunnis, some are radical Shi\u2019ites. Some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate from the 7th century, others want to trigger the apocalyptic return of an imam from the 9th century. They operate in different lands, they target different victims \u2013 and they even kill each other in their quest for supremacy,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\n\u201cBut they all share a fanatic ideology. They all seek to create ever expanding enclaves of militant Islam where there is no freedom and no tolerance \u2013 where women are treated as chattel, Christians are decimated, and minorities are subjugated, sometimes given the stark choice: convert or die.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu turned to Iran, highlighting its involvement in terrorism around the world in recent years, accusing President Hasan Rouhani of \u201cdoublespeak\u201d and warning against any negotiated deal with Tehran that would leave intact its \u201cnuclear military facilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war.\u201d\n\nPsaki said later Monday that the U.S. was confronting both the ISIS threat and the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran \u201cbecause we feel both are important.\u201d", "", "CancelDone Cropping Drag the corners of the box above to crop your new profile photo.

For conservatives dubious of the feckless GOP beltway bunch, this has been a refreshing change and helped the Kentucky Senator establish himself as a true contender for the 2016 Presidential nomination. While this trait is without doubt a positive one, Rand Paul\u2019s criticism of Republican\u2019s efforts to establish voter ID laws in various states is the wrong issue to tackle and counterproductive to the overall goals of increasing genuine dialogue with the black community.\n\nIn addition to his independence, Paul is to be legitimately commended for taking the lead in reaching out to African-American voters. His ideas on how we fight the drug war, sentencing and civil liberties are timely and come with reasoned solutions, rather than the sycophantic methods of the left. With his stance on voter ID laws however, he appears dangerously close to the pandering Democrats in gaining support by reinforcing red herring warnings of a society returning to the days of Jim Crow. Republicans, and in particular conservatives, certainly need to have open and honest discussions with the greater black community, but this is not the way to go about it.\n\nAt a recent gathering of Liberty PAC, a libertarian-leaning group, Paul was right to critique GOP appeal toward minorities when he noted, \u201cThe bottom line is, we aren\u2019t winning. We aren\u2019t winning because, its pretty simple, we don\u2019t have enough people in that group.\u201d In this regard he is absolutely correct, and the Republican Party is to be rightfully reproached in this. Despite being a party formed in large part as a direct result of the plight facing African-Americans, over the past 50 years the GOP has acquiesced the overall black vote to Democrats. This had been of dire consequence to both the Republican Party and black Americans as it has enabled a Progressive takeover of the Democratic Party and a disproportionate level of the negative impact of the Great Society to fall on the shoulders of the black community.\n\nThat Republicans previous failures at establish dialogue with black America, save a few standard election season efforts, have allowed Democrats to capture in upwards of 90 percent of African-American votes in many elections and gain near unanimous control of nearly every elected office in black communities. From City Council, to Alderman offices, congressional and state seats and most importantly (or rather devastatingly) local School Board seats. This has been the reality in America for going on 50 years now. This has come with a cost to the Republican Party, the black community and America as a whole. 50 years of Liberal-Progressive hegemony has in many ways reversed the historic progress black Americans have made on their American journey and have given back little, other than introduce the national culture to the terms \u201cbaby daddy.\u201d\n\nIn 1964 only 24 percent of all black children were born into single parent households, today that number stands at nearly 70 percent. Despite only encompassing 13 percent of the overall United States population, nearly half of all abortions performed are done on black women, 488,000 per year. If we include mothers of other races impregnated by black men, we are easily terminating the life of more than half a million black infants each and every year. These are numbers that even the leaders of the 20th century Klu Klux Klan would have thought to be impossible.\n\nDue to the inane and corrupt leadership of the Democrats in the inner-cities, economic opportunity is stalled, thus limiting the job prospects of black youths. With idle time on their hands, they have become fodder for the nefarious trappings of urban American life. As more and more entry-level jobs go to Democrats new favored voting bloc, Hispanic immigrants, legal and otherwise, millions upon millions of young black men have virtually given up on the traditional paths toward upward mobility and jump into the \u201chustlers life.\u201d Misplaced liberal sentiments of compassion for the criminal and restrictive urban gun laws for the law-abiding have further exacerbated the crime problems plaguing the good and honest folks in the black community, creating conditions that should never be tolerated in the greatest nation on earth.\n\nSo I ask with great sincerity Senator Paul, why embark on a course of dialogue which matches that of the opportunists we all know to be wicked. In playing the \u201crace card\u201d you lower yourself and divert attention away from the real problems facing African-Americans in lieu of emotional appeals that have dubious merit. As I pondered earlier in this piece, I will ask again, how many potential voters are truly going to be disenfranchised due to voter ID laws, particularly when state Republicans often include free identification programs when drafting these measures?\n\nI personally have challenged our party to place a greater emphasis on reaching out to minority voters and have previously commended Senator Paul\u2019s efforts in this regard. However, if we are going to do so by mimicking the strategy of the disingenuous left, and play off of historic fears and suspicions to do so, any gains we make in this area will be superficial and we will find ourselves becoming no better than Democrats. Indeed, let us as conservatives commit to increased open and honest dialogue with the black community at large, but by playing up the false argument that voter ID laws disenfranchise black voters, Rand Paul is stooping to a level that is both unproductive and unneeded. We have at our disposal 50 years of disastrous Democratic Party policy that is literally killing off African-Americans. Let us highlight these problems and counter with conservative ideas to rectify them, for a better black community, a better Republican Party and a better America.\n\nOpinion by Paul M Winters\n\nEditor in Chief, Dignitas News Service\n\nSources:\n\nBlackRepublicans (via YouTube)\n\nPolitico\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nStumbleUpon\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

The CNN debate this week made it absolutely clear that the Republican Koch boy has no hope of being a serious contender in the 2016 presidential race. He fought for the attention of the media and he lost. The most he could muster was a one-liner at the beginning of the debate that never landed \u2013 no one could understand it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need an apprentice in the White House,\u201d Walker said to Donald Trump. \u201cWe have one right now.\u201d\n\nThe group of candidates mostly stood there bemused, trying to understand what Walker was getting at.

Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63). This doesn\u2019t mean that it is unlimited, the same as all rights (more on that below). However, the court states that even though gun violence is a problem to be taken seriously, \u201cthe enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table\u201d (p.64).\n\n6. The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this. It\u2019s listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (\u201csecurity of a free state\u201d), then the people need arms: \u201cWhen the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny\u201d (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted \u201cthat history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents\u201d (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: \u201cduring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive\u201d (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens\u2019 militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).\n\n7. The Second Amendment was also meant as a provision to repel a foreign army invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find this one comical, but it\u2019s in there. The court notes one of many reasons for the militia to ensure a free state was \u201cit is useful in repelling invasions\u201d (p.24). This provision, like tyranny, isn\u2019t an everyday occurring use of the right; more like a once-in-a-century (if that) kind of provision. A popular myth from World War II holds Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese navy allegedly said \u201cYou cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\u201d Although there is no evidence of him saying this, there was concern that Japan might invade during WWII. Japan did invade Alaska, which was a U.S. territory at the time, and even today on the West Coast there are still gun embankments from the era (now mostly parks). The fact is that there are over 310 million firearms in the United States as of 2009, making a foreign invasion success less likely (that, and the U.S. military is arguably the strongest in the world).\n\n8. The Second Amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t unlimited: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d (p. 54). The Court upheld restrictions like the prohibition of arms by felons and the mentally ill, and carrying in certain prohibited places like schools and courthouses. What is protected are weapons \u201cin common use of the time\u201d (p.55). This doesn\u2019t mean weapons in common use \u201cat that time,\u201d meaning the 18th Century. The Court said the idea that it would is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\u201d (p.8). The Court\u2019s criteria includes weapons in popular widespread use \u201cthat [are] overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d (p. 56), and \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans\u201d (p. 58).\n\n9. The Second Amendment might require full-blown military arms to fulfill the original intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court didn\u2019t rule specifically on this in D.C. v. Heller, but noting that weapon technology has drastically changed (mentioning modern day bombers and tanks), they stated \u201cthe conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large\u201d (p. 55).\n\nThey further added that \u201cthe fact that modern developments [in modern weaponry] have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right\u201d (p. 56). A full ruling has not been made, as this was not in the scope the court was asked to rule on in the D.C. v. Heller case, but they left the door open for future ruling.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Feb 8, 2013.

From 2013 to 2014, the decline was $805.\n\nAccording to the Census, median household income divides the income distribution into two, so half of incomes are greater, and half of incomes are less than the median.", "1. The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63). This doesn\u2019t mean that it is unlimited, the same as all rights (more on that below). However, the court states that even though gun violence is a problem to be taken seriously, \u201cthe enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table\u201d (p.64).\n\n6. The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this. It\u2019s listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (\u201csecurity of a free state\u201d), then the people need arms: \u201cWhen the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny\u201d (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted \u201cthat history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents\u201d (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: \u201cduring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive\u201d (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens\u2019 militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).\n\n7. The Second Amendment was also meant as a provision to repel a foreign army invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find this one comical, but it\u2019s in there. The court notes one of many reasons for the militia to ensure a free state was \u201cit is useful in repelling invasions\u201d (p.24). This provision, like tyranny, isn\u2019t an everyday occurring use of the right; more like a once-in-a-century (if that) kind of provision. A popular myth from World War II holds Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese navy allegedly said \u201cYou cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\u201d Although there is no evidence of him saying this, there was concern that Japan might invade during WWII. Japan did invade Alaska, which was a U.S. territory at the time, and even today on the West Coast there are still gun embankments from the era (now mostly parks). The fact is that there are over 310 million firearms in the United States as of 2009, making a foreign invasion success less likely (that, and the U.S. military is arguably the strongest in the world).\n\n8. The Second Amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t unlimited: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d (p. 54). The Court upheld restrictions like the prohibition of arms by felons and the mentally ill, and carrying in certain prohibited places like schools and courthouses. What is protected are weapons \u201cin common use of the time\u201d (p.55). This doesn\u2019t mean weapons in common use \u201cat that time,\u201d meaning the 18th Century. The Court said the idea that it would is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\u201d (p.8). The Court\u2019s criteria includes weapons in popular widespread use \u201cthat [are] overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d (p. 56), and \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans\u201d (p. 58).\n\n9. The Second Amendment might require full-blown military arms to fulfill the original intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court didn\u2019t rule specifically on this in D.C. v. Heller, but noting that weapon technology has drastically changed (mentioning modern day bombers and tanks), they stated \u201cthe conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large\u201d (p. 55).\n\nThey further added that \u201cthe fact that modern developments [in modern weaponry] have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right\u201d (p. 56). A full ruling has not been made, as this was not in the scope the court was asked to rule on in the D.C. v. Heller case, but they left the door open for future ruling.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Feb 8, 2013.

It\u2019s Islamophobia!!!\n\nBut wait\u2026 what if\u2026 he didn\u2019t actually build any clock?!\n\nFrom AV Artvoice Blog:\n\nI\u2019m an electronics geek. I was interested in the clock! I wanted to figure out what he had come up with. I found the highest resolution photograph of the clock I could. Instantly, I was disappointed. Somewhere in all of this \u2013 there has indeed been a hoax. Ahmed Mohamed didn\u2019t invent his own alarm clock. He didn\u2019t even build a clock. Now, before I go on and get accused of attacking a 14 year old kid who\u2019s already been through enough, let me explain my purpose. I don\u2019t want to just dissect the clock. I want to dissect our reaction as a society to the situation. Part of that is the knee-jerk responses we\u2019re all so quick to make without facts. So, before you scroll down and leave me angry comments, please continue to the end (or not \u2013 prove my point, and miss the point, entirely!) For starters, one glance at the printed circuit board in the photo, and I knew we were looking at mid-to-late 1970s vintage electronics. Surely you\u2019ve seen a modern circuit board, with metallic traces leading all over to the various components like an electronic spider\u2019s web. You\u2019ll notice right away the highly accurate spacing, straightness of the lines, consistency of the patterns. That\u2019s because we design things on computers nowadays, and computers assist in routing these lines. Take a look at the board in Ahmed\u2019s clock. It almost looks hand-drawn, right? That\u2019s because it probably was. Computer aided design was in its infancy in the 70s. This is how simple, low cost items (like an alarm clock) were designed. Today, even a budding beginner is going to get some computer aided assistance \u2013 in fact they\u2019ll probably start there, learning by simulating designs before building them.\n\nNow, the blogger continues to show that basically what Ahmed did is buy an old clock, rip out it\u2019s insides, stuff it into another box, and take off to school.\n\nSo I turned to eBay, searching for vintage alarm clocks. It only took a minute to locate Ahmed\u2019s clock. See this eBay listing, up at the time of this writing. Amhed\u2019s clock was invented, and built, by Micronta, a Radio Shack subsidary. Catalog number 63 756. The shape and design is a dead give away. The large screen. The buttons on the front laid out horizontally would have been on a separate board \u2013 a large snooze button, four control buttons, and two switches to turn the alarm on and off, and choose two brightness levels. A second board inside would have contained the actual \u201cbrains\u201d of the unit. The clock features a 9v battery back-up, and a switch on the rear allows the owner to choose between 12 and 24 hour time. (Features like a battery back-up, and a 24 hour time selection seems awful superfluous for a hobby project, don\u2019t you think?) Oh, and about that \u201cM\u201d logo on the circuit board mentioned above? Micronta.\n\nSooooo\u2026. what happened here? The blogger draws some conclusions:\n\nSo there you have it folks, Ahmed Mohamad did not invent, nor build a clock. He took apart an existing clock, and transplanted the guts into a pencil box, and claimed it was his own creation. It all seems really fishy to me. If we accept the story about \u201cinventing\u201d an alarm clock is made up, as I think I\u2019ve made a pretty good case for, it\u2019s fair to wonder what other parts of the story might be made up, not reported factually by the media, or at least, exaggerated. I refer back again to this YouTube video interview with Ahmed. He explains that he closed up the box with a piece of cord because he didn\u2019t want it to look suspicious. I\u2019m curious, why would \u201clooking suspicious\u201d have even crossed his mind before this whole event unfolded, if he was truly showing off a hobby project, something so innocuous as an alarm clock. Why did he choose a pencil box, one that looks like a miniature briefcase no less, as an enclosure for a clock? It\u2019s awful hard to see the clock with the case closed. On the other hand, with the case open, it\u2019s awful dangerous to have an exposed power transformer sitting near the snooze button (unless, perhaps his invention was to stop serial-snooze-button pressers by giving them a dangerous electrical shock!)\n\nNow I think it\u2019s a real leap in logic to believe this was all an elaborate CAIR planned hoax. They would have done it better if it was. What it seems like is this dumb kid did this as a joke, got caught, and it was taken WAYY too far, and the easiest way to get out of it was to claim racism, or Islamophobia.\n\nAnd the proof of this, is that he really didn\u2019t invent the clock.\n\nAlso Obama is an idiot.\n\nUPDATE!!!

The amendment, touted as \u201cgun control compromise,\u201d was crafted by Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) and it was defeated in the Senate in the first major vote of the session.\n\nThat the Manchin-Toomey background checks plan failed to pass the Senate is a good thing; the amendment was not a \u201ccompromise\u201d as it had been touted, and would not have solved any gun crime issues. The marketing propaganda mustered to attempt to sell it was itself built upon lies and misinformation, and President Obama\u2019s feigned moral outrage over its failure is both insulting and the true shame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Obama lost his mind when he told reporters at the White House: \u201cInstead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill\u201d. The President called the day \u201cshameful,\u201d and the White House sent out a mass email with the same wording. The president will forgive me if I\u2019m not moved. If you watched his address immediately following Sandy Hook and witnessed the fake tears flicked away from the outside of his eyes, you\u2019ll know what I mean. Shameful? This same president, who used many an opportunity to stand with children and parents of the victims (some would call that exploitation or grandstanding) in pleading the case for his version of a solution to children being senselessly murdered, also orders drone strikes that senselessly murder innocent. Lies? This is the same president who lied about Benghazi being a \u201cspontaneous demonstration\u201d for weeks. This amendment itself was based on lies. As I said, you\u2019ll forgive me if I\u2019m not moved by yet another false show of \u201cmoral outrage.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s talk about lies. This amendment was supposed to close the so-called \u201cgun show loophole.\u201d There is no such \u201cloophole.\u201d The amendment was also supposed to close the \u201conline loophole.\u201d This is an even bolder of a lie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president had falsely claimed that \u201cup to 40%\u201d of guns are bought without a background check via the so-called \u201cgun show loophole,\u201d for which the Washington Post Fact-Checker gave him two \u201cPinocchios\u201d (update: upped to three pinocchios) for being misleading. This false claim comes from a 1994 study of 251 people from before the Brady Bill required Federal Firearms Licensed (FFL) retail sellers to run background checks on all sales. The Washington Post reconnected with the original study authors who informed them the actual range is 14-22% with a +/- error margin of 6%, meaning the final range is 8-28%. That\u2019s nowhere near 40%. Also, factor in that it was before the Brady Bill was passed and it was from 1994. According to the ATF, federal law requires FFL holders to run a background check on all sales no matter where they are, retail storefront, and gun show, what have you. Failure to do so is already a crime.\n\nWhat about private sales? Private sales are from any private citizen who does not hold a FFL. These are, and have been since before the beginning of time, been 100% legal to another private, non-FFL holding person. Technically, the law states that if someone knowingly transfers a gun to a prohibited person (felon, mentally ill, etc.) they are breaking the law. But if you are not knowingly selling a firearm to such a person, you are not breaking the law. What about location? Does it matter if the private sale is in your driveway, parking lot, swap meet, gun show, or back alley? Nope. Private sale is private sale, regardless of whether there happen to be FFL\u2019s at the next table, or in the next county. Ostensibly, the concern is that continuing to \u201callow\u201d the \u201cinbred, non-showering, redneck hicks\u201d that attend gun shows the \u201cprivilege\u201d of selling their private property at gun shows is that crazed mass killers and terrorists are going to frequent gun shows to get fully automatic machine guns only to drive to the nearest mall or Kindergarten class with 2,000 rounds of ammunition and go out with a blaze of hellfire on our innocent hindquarters. This is pure fairy tale. The Department of Justice studies of where felons acquire their firearms show that less than 1% get them from gun shows. The majority \u2014 nearly 80% \u2014 of them gets them from (already) illegal transfer via family/friends, or from the black market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe myth about the online loophole is a clever-ish sort of new lie perpetrated by anti-gunners. To listen to them, you\u2019d think one could hop onto Amazon.com or some sort of \u201cGuns-R-Us.com,\u201d and order your made-for-mass-murder killing machine sent via UPS to your front door. Pure hogwash. There are plenty of online gun retailers, but none of them will ship you personally a gun; it must go to a FFL retailer who then must run a background check on you. Failure to do so is a crime. They are retailers, not black market underworld kingpins; they\u2019re in business to make money, not go to prison for yours or my sake. These retailers only ship guns to FFL holders. Not to mention that they themselves hold FFLs and must comply with the law governing retail sales regardless of location.\n\nWhat about private sales conducted online via classifieds? This is a little trickier. For one, many places like Craigslist, don\u2019t allow guns sales. But for classified ad sites that do allow them, this is no different than placing a classified ad in your local newspaper. It is, and always has been 100% legal. All the same rules discussed above still apply. If shipping out of state, it must go to an FFL; failure to do so is already a crime. If sold locally, there are no restrictions as has always been the case. If the president and gun control advocates wanted to refer to closing all \u201cprivate\u201d sales, and be honest about the fact that you\u2019re changing the law. Don\u2019t call it a \u201cloophole;\u201d which as I wrote previously, calling something a \u201cloophole\u201d that was never illegal to begin with, and doesn\u2019t involve \u201cgetting around\u201d something on a technicality, is itself a war waged with words and dishonest political gamesmanship. Gun control advocates might garner more support and sympathy if they didn\u2019t rely on lies to make their case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the president acts as if the Senate just guaranteed another mass shooting (though even Vice President Biden admits their anti-gun efforts won\u2019t prevent another mass shooting). The truth is that this amendment failed to address any of the issues inherently existent in our current system: failure to fund NICS (the background check system), failure of many states to report mental health and felony data to NICS, failure to address straw man purchases, failure to enforce and prosecute illegal transfer and background check fraud. And it fails to address the black market, illegal weapons trafficking (which is done by trans-national gangs according to the FBI), and theft \u2013 including targeted theft of police and military equipment.\n\nThe greatest lie of all is that this amendment would have done anything to decrease homicides or prevent another great tragedy. The decision to engage in lies and propaganda in lieu of actually addressing the underlying causes of violence and homicide in the U.S. is the real tragedy. That\u2019s what Obama and other politicians like him ought to be ashamed of.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Apr 23, 2013.

Rolling appropriations bills together into one massive package under the threat of government shut-down is concerning because it doesn\u2019t allow for close scrutiny of where taxpayer dollars are going. Congress and the President should adhere to the budget deadlines they are legally required to follow, including submitting budgets on time and considering appropriations bills separately and fully.\n\n*A bipartisan vote came to pass in the House on March 25, 2015.

Repealing the Death Tax would encourage people to save and invest, knowing that the federal government would not seize nearly half of their estate when they die\u2013 and more importantly, it would prevent the government from treating death as a taxable event.\n\nBring American Profits Home\n\nThe United States is currently the only developed economy that uses a worldwide tax system. Under this system, income earned abroad is taxed at both the host-country rate, and then subjected to U.S. taxes as well when it is brought home. This uncompetitive tax system has led to two outcomes.\n\nFirst U.S companies are sitting on nearly $2 trillion dollars of income \u201cparked\u201d overseas that they are unwilling to bring back to the U.S. because of the built-in tax disincentive. Second, many companies are seeking \u201cinversions,\u201d an approach where they acquire or are acquired by a foreign company in order to put their billions of dollars overseas to productive use rather than forfeiting a large chunk of it in taxes.\n\nAllowing for tax-free repatriation of U.S. profits will help boost investment in U.S. jobs and growth, and reverse the perverse incentive of the current U.S. tax code that rewards companies for foreign job creation and mergers over investment in America and American workers.\n\n*While the budget resolutions approved by the House and Senate both contained placeholders for tax reform, no straight up or down votes have been held in either chamber. President Obama\u2019s views these overseas profits as a potential source of revenue, however, and has already announced his intention to subject them to a tax as part of a plan to underwrite additional infrastructure spending.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Alexis\u2019 family members also confirmed to the press that he was being \u201ctreated\u201d for his mental health problems. Across the medical industry, \u201ctreatment\u201d is the code word for psychiatric drugging.\u201d\n\nAlexis also suffered from PTSD, blackouts and anger issues \u2013 all of which are treated with SSRI drugs. The most common form of treatment for PTSD is Paroxetine, which is listed as the number 3 top violence-causing drug by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP).\n\nThe Navy Yard shooter was clearly on some form of psychiatric drug, but the media has shown no interest in discovering its identity.\n\nDespite it being reported that prescription drugs were found in the apartment of \u2018Batman\u2019 shooter James Holmes days after the Aurora massacre, it took nine months to find out exactly what those drugs were. Like Columbine killer Eric Harris, Holmes had been taking Zoloft, another SSRI drug linked with violent outbursts.\n\nThe length of time it took to find out that Holmes was on Zoloft was partly because the media habitually shows zero interest in pursuing the link between anti-depressants and violence.\n\nAs the website SSRI Stories profusely documents, there are literally hundreds of examples of mass shootings, murders and other violent episodes that have been committed by individuals on psychiatric drugs over the past three decades. The number of cases is staggering.\n\nWhy is the corporate media so disinterested in pursuing this clear connection?\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with the fact that the pharmaceutical giants who produce drugs like Zoloft, Prozac and Paxil spend around $2.4 billion dollars a year on direct-to-consumer television advertising every year. By running negative stories about prescription drugs, networks risk losing tens of millions of dollars in ad revenue.\n\nWhile failing to ask questions about what SSRI drugs Aaron Alexis was taking prior to his rampage, the media instead blamed the shooting on assault rifles, even after it had been confirmed that no AR-15 was used by Alexis during the massacre.\n\nFBI assistant director Victoria Parlave stated at a press conference on Tuesday that authorities, \u201cdo not have any information at this time that [Alexis] had an AR-15 in his possession.\u201d\n\nDespite there being no evidence that an AR-15 was used, the New York Daily News ran a front page headline yesterday morning entitled, \u201cSame Gun Different Slay,\u201d next to a picture of an assault rifle.\n\nHours after the FBI stated that no AR-15 had been used, MSNBC\u2019s Alex Wagner, who previously blamed the Boston bombings on Alex Jones, continued to use an animated graphic depicting Alexis carrying an assault rifle during the massacre.\n\nAnti-second amendment crusader Piers Morgan also erroneously blamed the shooting on \u201ca man with a legally purchased AR-15, who just committed the same kind of atrocity as we saw at Sandy Hook, and Aurora,\u201d during his CNN show on Monday.\n\nCNN\u2019s live news coverage also reported that Alexis had \u201crecently purchased (an) AR-15 shotgun,\u201d when in fact that purchase had been denied.\n\nBoth the New York Times and the Washington Post also falsely reported that an AR-15 had been found on Alexis after the massacre.\n\nD.C. gun grabbers Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin also regurgitated the false claim that Alexis used an AR-15 during the rampage.\n\nThe U.S. press has once again behaved like state media in the aftermath of the Navy Yard shooting by pursuing the assault rifle angle \u2013 despite the fact that it was patently false \u2013 in order to bolster the White House\u2019s gun control agenda.\n\nIn doing so, they have concurrently buried an integral aspect of mass shootings that needs to be highlighted as part of a national conversation \u2013 the clear connection between violent outbursts and SSRI drugs.\n\nFacebook @ https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71\n\nFOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson @ https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet\n\n*********************\n\nPaul Joseph Watson is the editor and writer for Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.

Police put him in handcuffs and, even after the confusion passed, the boy was suspended from school.\n\nThat earned Mohamed a planned trip to the White House, a message of support from Hillary Clinton, an offer to stop by Facebook to meet Mark Zuckerberg and an invitation to be an intern at Twitter.\n\nThe police overreacted. Yet the device did look like something Ethan Hunt would lob out of a helicopter at the last minute in \u201cMission: Impossible.\u201d As National Review\u2019s Charles Cooke pointed out on Twitter, the scary-looking tangle of wires \u201clooks a lot more like a bomb than a pop tart looks like a gun.\u201d\n\nJosh Welch, a white Maryland kid with ADHD who was 7 years old when he was kicked out of school for chewing a Pop-Tart into the shape of a pistol and pretending to shoot other students with it, must be puzzled.\n\nWhere\u2019s his White House invitation? Where\u2019s his chance to start networking at Facebook? His parents were forced to hire a lawyer and spent a year and a half just trying to get the suspension erased from the kid\u2019s record. They were repeatedly refused.\n\n\u201cI stand with Ahmed, too. But I also stand with Alex Stone,\u201d noted Reason writer Robby Soave. Alex Stone, a 16-year-old white kid from Summerville, SC, wrote a short story in which he imagined using a gun to kill a dinosaur. For this his locker was searched and he was arrested, handcuffed, charged with \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d and suspended from school for three days.\n\nObviously the White House and Mark Zuckerberg couldn\u2019t be bothered to comment, but you\u2019d think that, at the very least, Stephen King would have sent out a tweet expressing outrage that imagination was being punished.\n\nNada.\n\nIn Dyer County, Tenn., Kendra Turner says she was suspended for saying, \u201cBless you\u201d after a student sneezed, and that her teacher told her that she would have no \u201cgodly speaking in class.\u201d\n\nA school administrator said, \u201cThis was not a religious issue at all, but more of an issue the teacher felt was a distraction in her class.\u201d Uh-huh. School leadership offered no explanation for the photos posted by students that showed \u201cbless you\u201d on a list of expressions banned in the classroom. Turner is still waiting for her call from President Obama.\n\nAre white kids being punished en masse for dopey quasi-infractions because of their race? Of course not. That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nBut it\u2019s equally absurd to suggest that you have to be Muslim, or brown-skinned, or live in Texas, to be subjected to overenthusiastic use of school discipline and police force.\n\n\u201cIt never would have happened to a white kid\u201d? It happens to white kids all. The. Time.\n\nThe main difference between the Ahmed Mohamed case and the others is that the mainstream media and the leftist point of view it presents just can\u2019t let go of Ahmed. Ahmed is too useful to their narrative to be a one-day story.\n\nThat Bristol Palin said on Facebook that President Obama didn\u2019t need to get involved in the situation proved irresistible for the media, which loves to depict America as a bitter standoff between red-state hicks on the one hand and sophisticated members of the cool bicoastal techno-media club on the other.\n\nLet\u2019s just savor for a moment that the musings of the daughter of an unemployed former governor constitute national news. This year the brother of a sitting president made derogatory comments about the leader of the free world and the reaction from the media was crickets.\n\nMalik Obama gets the courtesy of being ignored because he has also said some crazy things. Now imagine Bristol Palin making loony statements. Would the media decline to cover them?\n\nFor 14 years and two weeks now, the left has been desperate to find some evidence, any evidence, that Muslims in general are facing deep-seated discrimination because a few Muslims attacked us on 9/11.\n\nThat American Muslims have instead mostly been treated with respect and courtesy ought to be a point of pride, but at no point will the left ever say, \u201cIsn\u2019t it great that we\u2019re such a pluralistic and tolerant country?\u201d\n\nThe left-led push to turn a man who was, as of 2004, an obscure state senator with no particular accomplishments, into the president four years later, was centrally and crucially about race. Everyone else was being subjected to a bait-and-switch.\n\nInstead of being credited with enlightenment for being the only white-majority country ever to elect a black leader, now we\u2019re told that everything is about racism.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Meanwhile the current Democratic incumbent, undaunted by his infamous description of ISIS as a \u201cjunior varsity team,\u201d is insisting that the intelligence analysts most responsible for fighting ISIS cook their books to make it seem as if we\u2019re winning despite inconvenient facts suggesting otherwise.\n\nThe Daily Beast, in Wednesday\u2019s exclusive story, reported a breaking scandal from within the ranks of intelligence analysts at the U.S. Central Command, ordinarily a highly secretive organization. \u201cMore than 50 intelligence analysts working out of the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command have formally complained that their reports on ISIS and al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria were being inappropriately altered by senior officials \u201d\n\nThis is hot stuff because intelligence analysts are normally an exceptionally closed-mouth bunch, believing that loose lips still sink ships and cost lives. But at Tampa\u2019s Central Command, that responsibility is taken even more seriously since CENTCOM is the war-fighting organization most responsible for carrying the fight to ISIS. The painstaking assessments of its analysts \u2013 about enemy order of battle, areas of concentration and chains of command \u2013 are the raw material of the nation\u2019s information-centered kill chain. When vague intelligence \u201cindicators\u201d are correlated with other data, intuition and shrewd comparisons can produce hard \u201csignatures.\u201d Only then are our pilots and Special Forces ordered into direct action, bringing firepower to destroy those often elusive targets.\n\nWhen you do that kind of thing for a living every day, then your expert evaluation about the success of the fight will naturally command high-level attention \u2013 and possibly even controversy as well. If \u201ckeep your mouth shut,\u201d is a common instinct among intelligence professionals, then a shared professional culture elevates \u201cgetting it right\u201d into a core value. But on those rare occasions when those values come into direct conflict with each other \u2013 that is when history is in the making.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, this is apparently the case now \u2013 and has been for months. Two central command intelligence analysts \u2013 supported by 50 of their colleagues \u2013 took the extraordinary step of signing a formal complaint to the department of defense inspector general, literally a life-or-death career move. They charge that their reports were being politicized to portray \u201cthe terror groups as weaker than the analysts believe they are.\u201d More specifically, \u201cThe analysts have accused senior-level leaders, including the director of intelligence and his deputy in CENTCOM, of changing their analyses to be more in line with the Obama administration\u2019s public contention that the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda is making progress.\u201d\n\nWhat may be even worse is that the pattern of bureaucratic deception has persisted, what one official described as a \u201ccancer\u201d at the highest levels. Against a backdrop of considerably more optimistic public assessments by President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and a host of multi-starred commanders, the central command analysts began their confrontation back in October.\n\nSo what happens when a courageous analyst fulfills his highest professional duty of speaking \u201ctruth to power?\u201d As documented by the Daily Beast, the Empire instinctively strikes back: Pessimistic reports are edited to include more happy talk while truly ominous assessments are short-stopped, contradicted or deep-sixed. An already-Darwinian personnel system with promotions slowed by budget-cuts easily reins in the odd maverick with a raised eyebrow or the chilling question, \u201cAre you really giving the boss what he expects here?\u201d Sometimes an emergency call to HR is made and early retirement options pointedly made clear.\n\nBut is any of that the fault of Barack Obama? Designated apologists like White House spokesman Josh Ernest will reflexively deny any such culpability. But any intelligence officer worth his or her salt knows that generals and presidents get precisely the kind of intelligence they deserve. Decision-making in the hierarchy of the U.S. government is a tightly closed loop that is exquisitely sensitive to every nuance, every shading of encouragement or discouragement. If the boss doesn\u2019t demand the kind of fearless intelligence that confirms or denies his most cherished preferences, then the entire weight of the federal bureaucracy instinctively closes ranks around him.\n\nWhere bad news is cut off, only catastrophe can enter, either a 9/11 or a Pearl Harbor. As Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling classically observed, surprise at Pearl Harbor was \u201csudden, concentrated and dramatic. The failure, however, was cumulative, widespread and rather drearily familiar.\u201d Just like today, from CENTCOM to the West Wing.\n\nA version of this piece previously appeared on Washington Times\n\nGuest columns do not necessarily reflect the views of Accuracy in Media or its staff.", "Seeking to inject some energy into his political campaign and show that the high-profile showdown with Wisconsin labor unions that made him famous has enduring relevance, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker this week laid out the most aggressive anti-union legislative agenda of any candidate in decades.\n\nRight now, organizing new workers into labor unions is challenging but unions that do exist have a number of legal and institutional protections and privileges that make them a force to be reckoned in business negotiations and political campaigns alike. Walker would make it harder to organize new unions, but also substantially change the status of existing unions to give them many fewer legal and financial resources to advance their vision of workers' interests.\n\nWalker's basic dislike of labor unions is pretty par for the course for conservative politicians these days, but Walker has a particular history with labor and a real passion for the cause of union-bashing. As governor, Walker took office in a fairly strong union state and he acted to curb their political power, defying massive protests and a recall vote then surviving a 2014 reelection battle in which he was one of labor's top targets. These battles are the political fire in which Walker's national reputation was forged, and his union reform plan is an effort to take the heat national.\n\nScott Walker's eight point plan\n\nThe plan can be broken down into eight main elements:\n\nThe last two of these are issues that are important to American unions, but the first six really strike at the heart of organized labor's role in American society. In combination, they would create a world in which collective bargaining as we know it does not exist and in which unions' role in lobbying and electioneering is drastically curtailed. Given the long-term structural decline in union membership from about a third of the workforce to ten percent of it (and lower than that in the private sector), this is more or less the world we are heading toward anyway. But Walker's agenda would greatly hasten the process and shut the door on any possibility for a union revival.\n\nWhy does Scott Walker hate unions?\n\nWalker's basic critique of labor unions is not especially unusual for a modern-day Republican Party politician. His view is that unions are creations of intrusive federal labor regulations, and like other conservative politicians he is not a fan of federal labor regulations. He thinks public sector unions increase the cost of government, and that a private sector union's legally established right to serve as the exclusive bargaining agent for an entire class of workers runs \"counter to the spirit of free enterprise and workplace flexibility.\"\n\nBut Walker takes an especially dim view of unions' political role. As Johns Hopkins University political scientist Daniel Schlozman writes in his new book When Movements Anchor Parties, labor unions have a unique role in the Democratic Party and in forging the modern-day liberal coalition.\n\nTo this day, some unions (especially police, fire, and building trades) sometimes endorse some Republican candidates but on the whole labor is an important source of money and a major source of manpower to Democratic campaigns. Labor also participates centrally in many multi-pronged progressive coalitions. Democrats don't always do what unions want \u2014 the Obama administration has often found itself at odds with labor on issues related to trade and K-12 education \u2014 but labor opposition to an administration initiative is one of the only things that can prompt massive congressional defections from Obama's agenda.\n\nWalker repeatedly refers to unions as \"special interests\" and public sector unions (which, these days, account for most union members) as \"big-government special interests.\"\n\nWhere Walker differs from other Republicans is not so much in his view of unions on the merits, but in his view of their centrality to political conflict. Walker sees Ronald Reagan's confrontation with the air traffic controllers' union as an event of world-historical significance. Where some liberals see the nefarious hand of the Koch Brothers as the key reason their own political hopes and dreams are not realized, Walker sees union power as the master key to American politics. Take risky political steps to crush union power as he did in Wisconsin and you'll open the doors to political change. This is, in part, self-serving since it casts his own governorship as consequential in a way that Jeb Bush's was not. But it also gives every appearance of being sincere.\n\nScott Walker has two-level strategy\n\nOne of the planks of this program is really not like the others, namely the proposal that it be made illegal for a labor union to be designated as the exclusive bargaining agent of a given set of workers.\n\nThis is, under current US law, more or less what it means for there to be a labor union. When you say that the pilots at American Airlines or the journalists at Gawker Media or the teachers in Chicago Public Schools are unionized, what you mean is that there is a union that is legally designated to bargain collectively for those classes of workers. No exceptions to the collective bargain and no side-deals allowed. There's a union and the union negotiates the contract.\n\nIf you get rid of that \u2014 as Walker is proposing to do \u2014 everything else becomes more or less irrelevant.\n\nSo you can think of the other planks as something like a backup strategy. If Walker isn't able to make collective bargaining impossible altogether, he wants to make it harder for unions to win organizing elections, harder to use the contract process to obtain funds, and harder to use funds for political purposes. If necessary, he will specifically try to curb public sector unions and be more lenient to private sector ones.\n\nBut his overarching vision is of an America where there is no collective bargaining. Workers may form clubs of some kind that they might or might not choose to refer to as labor unions, but they would not perform the core bargaining function of a union as we understand it.\n\nScott Walker wants laxer enforcement of existing labor law\n\nOne of Walker's more dramatic-sounding proposals is that he wants to entirely eliminate the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which currently enforces many aspects of labor law, and devolve its functions to the National Mediation Board (which mostly handles airline disputes) and the judiciary.\n\nThis, he says, is because the NLRB \"has become a one-sided advocate for big labor special interests.\"\n\nIn reality, the NLRB is composed of presidential appointees so its attitude tends to swing according to the prevailing winds in the White House. Under Barack Obama the NLRB has acted as a fairly loyal ally of labor and shifting its powers to the judiciary would produce a less union-friendly outcome. But a Scott Walker administration could easily achieve this by appointing union-hostile NLRB members rather than going through the trouble of changing the law.\n\nA national right-to-work law would cost unions money\n\nA little bit confusingly, right-to-work (RTW) laws do not establish a right to work. Instead, they prohibit certain kinds of contractual arrangements between employers and employees at unionized workplaces. It's easier to understand what RTW does if you first look at how things typically work in a unionized private-sector workplace in a non-RTW state.\n\nFirst, you have to start a labor union and get it recognized as the bargaining agent for a specific class of workers. Then once the union is in place, it has to negotiate a first contract with the employer. In almost every case, one provision of that contract is going to be that every worker in the bargaining unit needs to either join the union (and pay dues) or else pay a \"representation fee\" to the union \u2014 the idea being that since all workers in the bargaining unit benefit from the contract's gains for workers, all should contribute to the union's work.\n\nIn an RTW state, these representation fee agreements are illegal. You can join the union and pay dues, or you can stay out of the union and keep your money.\n\nNaturally, some people are going to avail themselves of this option thus significantly reducing the revenue available to the union. However, while right-to-work laws are in place in about half of American states they coexist with the federal rules governing the idea of a union as an exclusive bargaining agent. Walker wants to scrap this rule, which would drastically change the context for RTW laws and possibly render them irrelevant.\n\nRepealing Davis-Bacon would make construction projects cheaper\n\nThe \"Davis-Bacon\" rule is a law dating from the 1930s that requires workers on federally funded construction projects to be paid the local \"prevailing wage\" for a person in their line of work. A contractor cannot, in other words, bring workers in from a lower-wage region or undercut other bidders by employing non-union workers in a heavily unionized region. By the same token, even in a severe recession the government cannot scoop up a bunch of people off the unemployment rolls at low wages.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that repealing this rule would save the federal government about $12 billion over ten years. Alternatively, spending could stay flat and the federal government could undertake somewhat more projects at a somewhat lower per-project rate.\n\nAn attack on unions this drastic is politically risky\n\nRepublicans have advanced union-unfriendly measures for years, typically in a somewhat subtle way working through regulatory and judicial channels and chipping away at ancillary aspects of union power. With union membership steadily dropping as a share of the economy, time appears to be on the side of anti-union forces and it does not seem obviously important to take dramatic, highly visible actions.\n\nWalker's program, however, is so sweeping as to essentially just be asking the question of whether or not there should be any labor unions at all. Americans' answer to this question is pretty consistently yes, so there is some risk in taking this approach.\n\nOf course, union leaders will inevitably support Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders) against any plausible Republican nominee so simply going for the death blow makes a certain amount of sense. On the other hand, unions have traditionally had an imperfect ability to deliver the votes of their own members \u2014 in 2012, 40 percent of residents of union households voted for Mitt Romney \u2014 and Walker could be putting their support at risk.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

There is a segment of the population today that hates America, its people, and the nation\u2019s founding document, but instead of packing up and leaving the country, they have tasked Republicans to punish the entire population by legislating that all Americans suffer their lifestyle founded on poverty, bigotry, ill-health, and religious ignorance. Although there are Americans who hate this nation across the country, it is the former Confederacy that is punishing the people because they failed in their attempt to destroy America of their rejection of the United States Constitution they claim to love.\n\nSouthern states are still resentful they were unable to rip America apart because the Constitution forbade them from keeping dark-skinned human beings as livestock, so they spent the past 149 years punishing different groups of Americans based on their religion\u2019s instruction manual (Christian bible). Over the past thirty years, angry southerners began electing Republicans to strip everything from the people until they relented to a government by bible that drove their attempt to restrict other Americans from their Constitutional freedoms. Republicans have happily accommodated southerners to bring down the rest of the nation to their level of poverty and distress that southern red state voters embrace so long as they have imaginary enemies who believe Americans deserve more than slave wages, sickness, dire poverty, prayer, and firearms.\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge the former Confederacy considered owning human beings a biblically-supported and constitutional right according to their interpretation of the 10th Amendment. But even after losing the Civil War they persisted in targeting other groups for discrimination with biblical justification. Since their war against America, southern states opposed interracial marriage, women\u2019s right to vote, civil rights, voting rights, women\u2019s right to choose their reproductive health, and recently gay rights. The impetus for their opposition to those rights guaranteed in the Constitution is founded in their religion and since they were prohibited by the Constitution from depriving those groups of their rights, they have taken out their anger on the rest of the population by electing Republicans to Congress who promise to subject every American to conditions red southern state residents live under including poverty, slave wages, sickness and disease, and no hope of ever escaping their chosen lifestyle.\n\nIt is difficult for reasonable Americans to comprehend why voters in the South continue electing Republicans that campaign on perpetuating living conditions most Americans consider unacceptable. It is not because they believe all Americans live in poverty and love it, or that they are unaware their miserable plight is unavoidable. Most likely they are willing to live in poverty and ill-health with no chance of escaping because they are angry the rest of the nation will not tolerate their bigotry and hate; their only recourse is electing Republicans to legislate America into one big red state mired in bigotry, religion, guns, and deep poverty.\n\nAccording to The Department of Agriculture\u2019s measure of poverty, every red state from Arizona to South Carolina has the highest poverty rates in America; between 17.9% and 22.8%. The so-called bible belt is America\u2019s poverty belt including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, nearly one in four children trapped in Southern red states live in dire poverty and parents of those children elect Republicans to make those despicable statistics uniform across America. Part and parcel of conditions driving the South\u2019s poverty is low wages that voters elect Republicans to perpetuate across America.\n\nSouthern states are hostile to organized labor, five states have no state minimum wage, most are \u201cright to work for less\u201d states, and the 10 states with the lowest average incomes are in the former Confederacy including Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma according to the Equality of Economic Opportunity Project. Republicans in Congress promote policies that create poverty across the South and red state voters elect them anyway to subject the entire nation to low wages and the poverty they engender.\n\nThe depth of Southern voters\u2019 hatred for other Americans and their own families is evident in their support for Republicans that rejected expanding Medicaid in most of the South. According to a map by the Urban Institute, counties with the most people without healthcare insurance are in the Southern United States and it defies comprehension why voters support Republicans who prevent their children, parents, brothers and sisters from access to healthcare that does not cost states one cent for the first few years and only 10% (at most) thereafter. The same voters avidly oppose the Affordable Care Act that reveals they want tens-of-millions of Americans to suffer the same ill-health and disease they choose for their families.\n\nIt is unfathomable that residents in southern red states reject attempts to help them climb out of poverty and sickness, but religion and guns are powerful motivators for people still holding a grudge over being prevented from owning slaves, restricting women\u2019s rights, and discriminating against Americans according to their religious beliefs. It is no coincidence that the poorest Southern states are also the most religious and have the most firearm violence. In fact, the poorest states have the highest incidence of gun violence to go along with some of the highest gun ownership rates that Republicans take advantage of by joining the National Rifle Association fear mongering that President Obama is coming after their guns as fervently as he is coming after their religious liberty.\n\nMany pundits assert the conditions in southern red states are the fault of Republican-dominated legislatures, but without voters electing Republicans and teabaggers to preserve the deplorable conditions southern states would not lead the nation in poverty. Unfortunately, the same people electing Republicans at the state level vote for Republicans in Congress because they promise to oppose Democrats and President Obama\u2019s campaign to disarm Southern state residents\u2019 of their guns and bibles. It is certain that if President Obama and Democrats supported religious-driven bigotry and gun fanaticism, red southern state voters would reciprocate and support policies giving them decent wages, healthcare, and domestic programs to combat poverty. However, since that will never happen they will vote to elect Republicans to Congress to impose their deplorable living conditions on the entire population and spread their real America to every state in the Union.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Using a quarters-based metric, the economic expansion has not been continuous, and the press needs to stop pretending that it has been. The economy shrank at an annualized rate of 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 2011, and contracted by 0.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014.

There is reason to believe that the government has made the benchmarks for what qualifies as \"looking for work\" tougher since Dear Leader took office.

Cassidy is now leading the efforts of the SC Foundation for Public Charter Schools to build additional financial support for the schools of the state-wide district. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about furthering the well-being of these schools,\u201d said Cassidy. \u201cOur goal is to develop a support system for these schools that will empower the entire professional learning community in each school to provide the highest quality public education that they can.\u201d Cassidy, who was appointed to federal education work by two previous US Presidents, is no stranger to public school choice and public charter schools, in particular. His efforts will reinforce the current seventeen schools of the District and the additional nine schools coming in August 2013.\n\nhttps://www.edreform.com/2013/04/charter-schools-in-sc-receive-awards-with-plans-to-open-9-more-schools/\n\nCOLUMBIA CHARTER SCHOOL\n\nRevocation Date (effective date on which organization\u2019s tax exemption was automatically revoked):\n\n15-Nov-2013\n\nEmployer Identification Number (EIN):\n\n45-1677909\n\nLegal Name:\n\nCOLUMBIA CHARTER SCHOOL\n\nDoing Business As:\n\nMailing Address:\n\n3810 N MAIN ST\n\nCOLUMBIA, SC 29203-6443\n\nUnited States\n\nExemption Type:\n\n00\n\nRevocation Posting Date (date on which IRS posted notice of automatic revocation on IRS.gov):\n\n11-Aug-2014\n\nLIBERTY ACADEMY CHARTER SCHOOL\n\nRevocation Date (effective date on which organization\u2019s tax exemption was automatically revoked):\n\n15-Nov-2010\n\nEmployer Identification Number (EIN):\n\n30-0272480\n\nLegal Name:\n\nLIBERTY ACADEMY CHARTER SCHOOL\n\nDoing Business As:\n\nMailing Address:\n\n7190 CROSS COUNTY RD\n\nN CHARLESTON, SC 29418-3303\n\nUnited States\n\nExemption Type:\n\n501(c)(3)\n\nRevocation Posting Date (date on which IRS posted notice of automatic revocation on IRS.gov):\n\n13-Jul-2011\n\nGREG MATHIS CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL\n\nRevocation Date (effective date on which organization\u2019s tax exemption was automatically revoked):\n\n15-Nov-2010\n\nEmployer Identification Number (EIN):\n\n01-0676352\n\nLegal Name:\n\nGREG MATHIS CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL\n\nDoing Business As:\n\nMailing Address:\n\n2872 AZALEA DR\n\nN CHARLESTON, SC 29405-8216\n\nUnited States\n\nExemption Type:\n\n501(c)(3)\n\nRevocation Posting Date (date on which IRS posted notice of automatic revocation on IRS.gov):\n\n09-Jun-2014\n\nExemption Reinstatement Date (effective date of tax exemption, determined by the IRS\n\nafter the organization\u2019s exemption was automatically revoked and the organization applied for reinstatement of exemption.):\n\n15-Nov-2010", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

There is a segment of the population today that hates America, its people, and the nation\u2019s founding document, but instead of packing up and leaving the country, they have tasked Republicans to punish the entire population by legislating that all Americans suffer their lifestyle founded on poverty, bigotry, ill-health, and religious ignorance. Although there are Americans who hate this nation across the country, it is the former Confederacy that is punishing the people because they failed in their attempt to destroy America of their rejection of the United States Constitution they claim to love.\n\nSouthern states are still resentful they were unable to rip America apart because the Constitution forbade them from keeping dark-skinned human beings as livestock, so they spent the past 149 years punishing different groups of Americans based on their religion\u2019s instruction manual (Christian bible). Over the past thirty years, angry southerners began electing Republicans to strip everything from the people until they relented to a government by bible that drove their attempt to restrict other Americans from their Constitutional freedoms. Republicans have happily accommodated southerners to bring down the rest of the nation to their level of poverty and distress that southern red state voters embrace so long as they have imaginary enemies who believe Americans deserve more than slave wages, sickness, dire poverty, prayer, and firearms.\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge the former Confederacy considered owning human beings a biblically-supported and constitutional right according to their interpretation of the 10th Amendment. But even after losing the Civil War they persisted in targeting other groups for discrimination with biblical justification. Since their war against America, southern states opposed interracial marriage, women\u2019s right to vote, civil rights, voting rights, women\u2019s right to choose their reproductive health, and recently gay rights. The impetus for their opposition to those rights guaranteed in the Constitution is founded in their religion and since they were prohibited by the Constitution from depriving those groups of their rights, they have taken out their anger on the rest of the population by electing Republicans to Congress who promise to subject every American to conditions red southern state residents live under including poverty, slave wages, sickness and disease, and no hope of ever escaping their chosen lifestyle.\n\nIt is difficult for reasonable Americans to comprehend why voters in the South continue electing Republicans that campaign on perpetuating living conditions most Americans consider unacceptable. It is not because they believe all Americans live in poverty and love it, or that they are unaware their miserable plight is unavoidable. Most likely they are willing to live in poverty and ill-health with no chance of escaping because they are angry the rest of the nation will not tolerate their bigotry and hate; their only recourse is electing Republicans to legislate America into one big red state mired in bigotry, religion, guns, and deep poverty.\n\nAccording to The Department of Agriculture\u2019s measure of poverty, every red state from Arizona to South Carolina has the highest poverty rates in America; between 17.9% and 22.8%. The so-called bible belt is America\u2019s poverty belt including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, nearly one in four children trapped in Southern red states live in dire poverty and parents of those children elect Republicans to make those despicable statistics uniform across America. Part and parcel of conditions driving the South\u2019s poverty is low wages that voters elect Republicans to perpetuate across America.\n\nSouthern states are hostile to organized labor, five states have no state minimum wage, most are \u201cright to work for less\u201d states, and the 10 states with the lowest average incomes are in the former Confederacy including Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma according to the Equality of Economic Opportunity Project. Republicans in Congress promote policies that create poverty across the South and red state voters elect them anyway to subject the entire nation to low wages and the poverty they engender.\n\nThe depth of Southern voters\u2019 hatred for other Americans and their own families is evident in their support for Republicans that rejected expanding Medicaid in most of the South. According to a map by the Urban Institute, counties with the most people without healthcare insurance are in the Southern United States and it defies comprehension why voters support Republicans who prevent their children, parents, brothers and sisters from access to healthcare that does not cost states one cent for the first few years and only 10% (at most) thereafter. The same voters avidly oppose the Affordable Care Act that reveals they want tens-of-millions of Americans to suffer the same ill-health and disease they choose for their families.\n\nIt is unfathomable that residents in southern red states reject attempts to help them climb out of poverty and sickness, but religion and guns are powerful motivators for people still holding a grudge over being prevented from owning slaves, restricting women\u2019s rights, and discriminating against Americans according to their religious beliefs. It is no coincidence that the poorest Southern states are also the most religious and have the most firearm violence. In fact, the poorest states have the highest incidence of gun violence to go along with some of the highest gun ownership rates that Republicans take advantage of by joining the National Rifle Association fear mongering that President Obama is coming after their guns as fervently as he is coming after their religious liberty.\n\nMany pundits assert the conditions in southern red states are the fault of Republican-dominated legislatures, but without voters electing Republicans and teabaggers to preserve the deplorable conditions southern states would not lead the nation in poverty. Unfortunately, the same people electing Republicans at the state level vote for Republicans in Congress because they promise to oppose Democrats and President Obama\u2019s campaign to disarm Southern state residents\u2019 of their guns and bibles. It is certain that if President Obama and Democrats supported religious-driven bigotry and gun fanaticism, red southern state voters would reciprocate and support policies giving them decent wages, healthcare, and domestic programs to combat poverty. However, since that will never happen they will vote to elect Republicans to Congress to impose their deplorable living conditions on the entire population and spread their real America to every state in the Union.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

All but three of them have been United States senators or state governors at some point in their careers. The other three, according to a Morning Consult poll of people who watched the 11 leading contenders debate this past Wednesday, are leading the race.\n\nA couple of big caveats: this is Morning Consult's first campaign season and it isn't yet a proven pollster, and the people who watched the Republican debates may not represent the party's primary electorate as a whole. But when you consider that this is a poll of Republicans (and independents who plan to vote in Republican primaries) who are engaged enough to watch an early debate \u2014 who one would think are the most engaged voters out there \u2014 it gets even more worrisome for the establishment.\n\nHere are four terrible signs for the GOP establishment in the poll, and one good one:\n\n1) Political n00bs get an outright majority of debate-watchers' support\n\n36 percent of poll respondents support Donald Trump; 12 percent support Ben Carson; and 10 percent support Carly Fiorina. All together, that's 58 percent of Republican debate-watchers who support one of the three candidates in the race with no experience in elected office whatsoever. To put it another way, none of the twelve candidates in the field with political experience managed to crack 10 percent of the vote.\n\n2) Fiorina's rising \u2014 but she's not taking Trump's support\n\nMost observers, including the poll's respondents, agreed Fiorina won the debate. Now, many pundits are portraying her as the new candidate with momentum \u2014 implying that she's seizing it from Trump.\n\nBut Trump not only failed to lose support after a debate where he was largely irrelevant to the proceedings, he actually gained 5 percentage points since the last Morning Connect poll was conducted a week ago. If neither Fiorina's rise nor his own debate performance has hurt Trump, it's getting hard to imagine what can.\n\n3) Jeb Bush's numbers are dismal \u2014 and Scott Walker's are even worse\n\n6 percent of poll respondents said they would vote for Jeb Bush. That ties him with Chris Christie for sixth place (behind Trump, Carson and Fiorina, as well as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio). Just like Trump is somehow still gaining support, Bush is somehow still losing it.\n\nIt is definitely bad news for the Republican establishment that their preferred candidate is getting 6 percent in the polls. But the man who was supposed to be his \"conservative challenger\" is doing even worse. Scott Walker, who when the race started was the closest thing to the candidate of the conservative movement, is polling at 1 percent. He is tied with former New York Governor George Pataki.\n\n4) The highest-polling elected official is Ted Cruz\n\nTed Cruz made his name, nationally, fighting the leadership of his own party in the Senate in the floor fight that resulted in the 2011 government shutdown. Ted Cruz is notoriously disliked by his Republican Senate colleagues. Ted Cruz's strategy over the last few months has been to buddy up with Donald Trump \u2014 even appearing at a rally in DC against the Iran nuclear deal together \u2014 in the hopes that when (or if) Trump's candidacy fades, Cruz will swoop in and take his support. Ted Cruz is, in other words, running against the fact that he is an elected official. Ted Cruz is polling better than all the other elected officials.\n\n5) But what if all of this is just very good news for Marco Rubio?\n\nIf you are an establishment Republican donor, all of this looks pretty dismal to you. But there is hope! After yet another quietly competent debate performance, Marco Rubio \u2014 who was once languishing with Christie and Rand Paul \u2014 is rising in the polls and, according to Morning Connect, right behind Cruz.\n\nRubio is incredibly amenable to conservative establishment preferences. In fact, the biggest problem with his candidacy so far was that some of the people who might support Rubio were instead backing Jeb Bush. In a happy coincidence, just as Bush's campaign is looking hopeless \u2014 and just as it's becoming clear that the anti-establishment candidates aren't going to take each other out on their own \u2014 Rubio's looking a little better. In other words, Marco Rubio has a pretty strong case that if the GOP donor base wants to take down Donald Trump, he, and not Bush, is the candidate they should bet on.", "Treating this stupid media controversy like it deserves to be treated, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump took to Twitter to wrist-flick away the latest bubbled, leftwing mainstream media frenzy.

We need it. We need everything we can get. Ethanol is terrific.\u201d\n\nHe was again questioned about religious liberty and what he can do to help protect Christians from having to violate their religious beliefs due to government regulations and laws.\n\n\u201cI feel so strongly in fact, it was mentioned in my second paragraph,\u201d he said, referencing his speech. \u201cReligious liberty is so important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a good fighter,\u201d he vowed, \u201cI win a lot,\u201d suggesting he would win the war against Christianity.\n\n\u201cI want Christmas re-used,\u201d Trump said of the campaign waged to remove the word \u201cChristmas\u201d from society in order to be more politically correct.\n\n\u201cEvery year it gets worse and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have nobody fighting for us.

Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\"", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Jeb Bush finished fifth in the straw poll with 9.7 percent of the 785 registered conference attendees who voted.\n\nThe Paul campaign celebrated the straw poll victory as a sign that the libertarian-minded senator\u2019s presidential bid remains alive, despite registering single-digit numbers in national polls.\n\n\u201cThis is an organization test that indicates that (Paul) will over-perform in other organizational contests such as Iowa, Nevada, Minnesota and other caucus states that come before the March 8 Michigan primary,\u201d said John Yob, Paul\u2019s national political director and a Grand Rapids-based GOP consultant.\n\nThe candidate also welcomed the result.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor to win the MRLC straw poll as it is voted on by the most influential Michigan GOP members, grassroots leaders and party activists from throughout the country\u2026,\u201d Paul said.\n\nThe top five presidential candidates in the straw poll each barnstormed Mackinac Island Friday and Saturday, engaging in retail politicking among 2,200 Michigan Republicans attending the state party\u2019s 31st biennial leadership conference. The top two vote-getters Paul and Fiorina were the last candidates to speak Saturday night at the Grand Hotel.\n\nSteve Mitchell, an East Lansing-based pollster, said the results were probably highly influenced by the Paul campaign bringing supporters to the island.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an effective strategy, and the campaign chooses to make that investment,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey also have supporters who are really true believers in their cause \u2014 people who will come up to the island. They have a record of always turning out the vote in a straw poll.\u201d\n\nPaul also won a straw poll at the 2013 GOP Mackinac conference.\n\nFiorina is likely still benefiting from her recent debate performance Wednesday night at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California., Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cShe is clearly a rising star, and she is the only \u2018she\u2019 in the race, so that\u2019s going to help attract some women,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cShe\u2019s a new face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the exception of Fiorina, the results are almost the inverse relationship to the results of recent polls of likely Republican Party primary voters \u2014 which is sort of fascinating,\u201d Mitchell added.\n\nWendy Day, state director for Cruz\u2019s campaign, downplayed the results late Saturday night, noting her candidate attracted an estimated 400 people to a Saturday morning rally at Mackinac Island\u2019s public school.\n\n\u201cWe had a completely organized showing at this event. We didn\u2019t pay for anybody\u2019s credentials,\u201d Day said. \u201cStraw polls are not always indicative of the actual ground game and the mood on the island.\u201d\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio and billionaire Donald Trump, who both did not attend the conference, trailed behind Bush with 8.4 percent and and 6.8 percent, respectively. Famed neurosurgeon and Detroit native Dr. Ben Carson, who also skipped the conference, finished eighth at 5.5 percent.\n\nGOP leaders, activists and donors attending the two-day convention favored Fiorina for vice president with 30.5 percent of the vote. Rubio finished second in the hypothetical vice presidential voting with 17 percent, followed by Kasich with 9.7 percent.\n\nMichigan Information & Research Service and The Detroit News started conducting the straw poll Friday and ended the survey of conference attendees at 10 p.m. Saturday after Paul delivered the final keynote address of the weekend.\n\nBefore his Saturday night speech, Paul held a rally at the nearby Gate House restaurant that was attended by about 65 students from Hillsdale College and other young Republicans from Saginaw Valley State University, Central Michigan University, Grand Valley State University and the University of Michigan.\n\n\u201cMore than anyone, I think he represents values like liberty, the Constitution and economic freedom,\u201d said Curran Hennessey of Grand Rapids. \u201cHe is in the best position to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Bush campaign sought straw poll votes, Michigan Chairman Bill Schuette, the state\u2019s attorney general, said Thursday the campaign was not \u201cactively campaigning for votes in the straw poll.\u201d\n\nBush had the stage to himself Friday night and said he would work to repair America\u2019s relations abroad and with Canada. The son and brother of two former presidents also sought to portray his family name as an asset, rather than a political liability, after several months of avoiding it.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had to cancel his Saturday morning speech because his charter plane couldn\u2019t land on Mackinac Island during an early morning rain storm. Walker finished ninth in the straw poll with 2.5 percent of the vote.\n\nAt a Saturday luncheon, Cruz and Kasich took turns making their pitches to the GOP faithful.\n\nCruz used his speech to warn against the encroaching size of government, while Kasich spoke in specific terms about how he would rein in the federal bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cIt was a contrast between the entertainer and the serious candidate,\u201d said Republican strategist Greg McNeilly, who is neutral in the presidential race but no fan of Cruz\u2019s candidacy.\n\nNatalie Griffin, a junior at Western Michigan University, said she was voting for Kasich because his views on the issues most closely align with hers, especially prioritizing mental health treatment and prison reform.\n\n\u201cEven on things that I don\u2019t necessarily agree with him on, he\u2019s still a moderate and not an extremist,\u201d said Griffin, who is studying to become a nurse.\n\nBefore filling out her ballot, Kristin Holcomb of Chelsea was wavering between Bush, Kasich and Fiorina.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for Mitt Romney to show up, honestly. But I think I\u2019ll go with Bush because he\u2019s my first \u2018love,\u2019\u201d said Holcomb, who lives half of the year in Florida.\n\n\u201cBut I could be swayed because I like the other two very much.\u201d\n\nMarylouise Fischbach of Grass Lake was leaning toward both Fiorina and Kasich \u2014 \u201cmore so Kasich at this point,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very smart and smart fiscally. He balanced the budget, and we need that,\u201d Fischbach said. \u201cI don\u2019t hold it against him that he went to Ohio State.\u201d\n\nMike Krafchak of Milford said he was voting for Trump, having been a fan since reading his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d when published in 1987.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a businessman, and I know what businessmen can do. I\u2019m looking for something new,\u201d Krafchak said, adding he\u2019s frustrated and disenchanted with the governing elite in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been able to prove he can get things done, over and over and over. I\u2019m very disappointed he\u2019s not here. I would have gone to Traverse City to pick him up.\u201d\n\nJared Maynard, a state GOP committee member from Macomb County, was volunteering for the campaign of Rubio, who did not attend the conference. Maynard said Rubio\u2019s humble roots appeal to his own blue-collar upbringing in Macomb County.\n\n\u201cMarco Rubio is a young guy who\u2019s ready to lead and bring actual leadership when you see him,\u201d Maynard said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1KnYSgq", "This video is unavailable.\n\nSorry about that.", "Published on Jun 23, 2015\n\nSometimes our work takes us into areas that appear to be \"science fiction,\" but under careful analysis the facts rise to the level of science fact and the implication is catastrophic!

Earlier this week, an Italian version of the encyclical was leaked online. There is a lot in the encyclical that is based on highly contentious \u201cscience\u201d regarding global warming, resources and regional development. Catholics should be reminded that the area of competence for a pope with regard to infallibility lies ONLY with those matters pertaining to the salvation of souls, namely faith and morals. Any discussions on the weather, contentious sciences, or concerns regarding economic resource allocation, except where they intersect with faith and morals, are entirely outside the purview of papal competence.\n\nThose matters within the encyclical pertaining to good stewardship and the care for the poor are to be taken with good grace as a loving guidance from our Holy Father, but we are not bound by obedience on any suggestions or recommendations as to how to implement such advice. As such, this is the area (as well as all of the references to contentious scientific matters) where there appears to be some issue.\n\nThe word \u201csustain\u201d (as itself or a part of the word \u201csustainable\u201d) appears in the leaked encyclical a total of 25 times and the word \u201cdevelopment\u201d appears 85 times. \u201cThe phrase \u201csustainable development\u201d appears 8 times and the United Nations appears only once. Now, I am working from a very low quality translation so this analysis will not be definitive, and I do hope to see some changes in the official version. But I\u2019ve decided to release this analysis prior to the official version of the encyclical because I suspect that the encyclical is going to be used as a bludgeon by the United Nations and its allies at Catholic Relief Services, Caritas Internationalis and a host of other Catholic social justice and development organizations to get Catholics anywhere and everywhere on-board with the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nI\u2019ll do an expose on the Sustainable Development Goals at another time, as well as publish a white paper on its predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals, showing wide-spread support from Catholic circles for the MDGs. The white paper on the MDGs, will show that the MDGs were a population-reduction program thinly disguised as a poverty-reduction program. The Sustainable Development Goals, written and guided by the same folks behind the Millennium Development Goals, is an extension of the MDGs \u2026 but more on that in another post.\n\nThe leaked encyclical\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csustainable development\u201d is troubling at best. Even if it isn\u2019t Pope Francis\u2019 intent to gather support for the Sustainable Development Goals, it\u2019s a solid bet that Catholic social justice agencies will use the Pope\u2019s words to ramp-up support for the SDGs. And that\u2019s a problem.\n\nBack in January of 2014, Pope Francis announced his intention to publish an encyclical on \u201chuman ecology.\u201d In May of 2014, the United Nations\u2019 climate chief, Christina Figures, said that the UN will back a letter by the pope on man\u2019s relationship with the environment. This is particularly troubling because it illustrates a tight connection between the United Nations and the encyclical in question.\n\nIn May of 2014, the UNFPA (the United Nations Population Fund) produced a document titled, \u201cRELIGION AND DEVELOPMENT POST-2015\u201d. On page 20 of the document is a section on the Sustainable Development Goals, and after explaining that the Sustainable Development Goals \u201cbalance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the environmental, social and economic,\u201d page 21 says the following:\n\n\u201cAppreciation of these issues is growing within the UN, as evidenced for example in the May 2014 meeting between the UN leadership and representatives of the Vatican and His Holiness the Pope on the SDG agenda. This meeting was followed by an audience between the UN Secretary-General and His Holiness, who committed the Catholic Church to support the SDG efforts.\u201d\n\nSo, according to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Pope Francis agreed, just months after announcing his intent to write an encyclical on \u201chuman ecology\u201d to \u201ccommit the Catholic Church to support the SDG efforts.\u201d This is not an inconsequential statement. The entire section in context is as follows. Pay particular attention to the portions that have been bolded and underlined:\n\nThe SDGs\n\n\u201cTo truly listen is to risk being changed forever.\u201d \u2014Northrup Frye\n\nThe concept of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was born at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, Rio+20, in 2012. The objective was to produce a set of universally applicable goals that balances the three dimensions of sustainable development: the environmental, social and economic. At this particular moment, the post-2015 and SDG processes are moving towards their conclusion, with issues important and relevant for all development actors. Our consultation in May 2014 was particularly timely, as each of the post-2015 agenda items critically intersect with religious traditions, with values, and with what humanity as a whole has been grappling with for millennia. The MDGs were a social agenda, but this is being greatly expanded into a radically different universal agenda that is not just about \u2018poor people\u2019, and is not just decided on in capitals. In fact, all are expected to take action, everywhere.\n\nThe Rio+20 conference emphasized that governments themselves want to be in the drivers\u2019 seat, instead of the development agenda being fashioned at the level of technocrats. This heightens the importance of an intergovernmental process complemented by an active series of dialogues and engagements with civil society organizations. A global conversation is evolving, involving 2.4 million people so far, through the \u2018World We Want\u2019 initiative (www.worldwewant2015.org). The conversations underline, clearly and unequivocally, that people around the world know precisely what kind of world they want to live in.\n\nThe post-2015 engagements to date, particularly with the results of the global conversations, simultaneously validate and yet are very different from the Millennium Development Goals. The top issues identified correspond to MDG articulations, with education appearing as the number one need, followed by access to education and quality health care for all. But in addition, there is a significant percentage of those who identified \u2018honest and responsive government\u2019 at a par with those who noted \u2018access to decent jobs\u2019; both areas were absent from the MDGs. These priorities were closely followed by food security, gender quality and freedom from fear and violence; also not included in the MDGs. It is important to note that while many identified needs are missing from the MDGs themselves, they nevertheless resonate strongly with the Millennium Declaration.\n\nAll of these needs are precisely what religions and other faith traditions grapple with. Faith is arguably the terrain where justice, peace and the struggle against inequality interface. This meeting is therefore an opportunity to consider how religious actors may be shaping or impacting upon the emerging agendas of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Appreciation of these issues is growing within the UN, as evidenced for example in the May 2014 meeting between the UN leadership and representatives of the Vatican and His Holiness the Pope on the SDG agenda. This meeting was followed by an audience between the UN Secretary-General and His Holiness, who committed the Catholic Church to support the SDG efforts. This entire meeting was remarkable.\n\nIn reading the context of this entire section of the UNFPA document on the Sustainable Development Goals, it is very clear that the intention of the United Nations is to use religions as a vehicle for selling the world its bill of goods. In paragraph 169 of the encyclical (below), the pope refers to the Sustainable Development Goals and the Rio+20 conference as facing difficulties because individual nations tend to serve their own interests over global interests. In the last sentence of that paragraph, the pope hopes and prays for \u201cpositive developments of the current discussions\u201d in order to avoid \u201cimprudent delay.\u201d It seems clear that the delay is a reference to adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, without saying so outright.\n\n169. With regard to care for biological diversity and desertification, progress has been much less significant. With regard to climate change, progress is woefully sketchy. The reduction of greenhouse gases requires honesty, courage and responsibility, especially by the most powerful countries and the most polluting. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, known as Rio + 20 (Rio de Janeiro 2012), issued wide as ineffective Final Declaration. International negotiations may not advance significantly because of the positions of the countries that favor their national interests than the global common good. How many will suffer the consequences that we try to cover up, remember this lack of awareness and responsibility. As he was elaborating this encyclical, the debate has taken on a special intensity. We believe we can only pray to God for the positive developments of the current discussions, so that future generations do not suffer the consequences of imprudent delay.\n\nAgain, this is a very low-quality translation, but the positive impression of the Sustainable Development Goals is evident, and what we are reading is quite possibly a clear endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals themselves. It certainly is no accident that Ban Ki Moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, and his architect of the Millennium Development Goals, Jeffrey Sachs (also a major proponent of population control), met with Pope Francis regarding the environment prior to the release of this encyclical; an encyclical whose leaked version contains supportive reference to the United Nations. It\u2019s also not coincidental that Carolyn Woo, the president and CEO of Catholic Relief Services, will speak at and be present for the official release of the encyclical as well. Also speaking at the release of the encyclical is the anti-Catholic, population-control promoting atheist, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, who is said to have helped draft the encyclical itself.\n\nIt is a reasonable conclusion that this encyclical (whether intended by Pope Francis or not) is going to be paraded around in order to get as many Catholic organizations as possible to support, promote and participate in the Sustainable Development Goals. And since Caritas Internationalis has already given full, unconditional support for the Millennium Development Goals (the predecessor of the Sustainable Development Goals), it\u2019s safe to say that we will VERY quickly see CRS and other major Caritas affiliates, and other Catholic social justice organizations immediately take the encyclical and use it as a bludgeon to tell Catholics that they have an obligation to participate in and support the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nLet\u2019s hope and pray that the official version being released this Thursday does not have the references to the United Nation\u2019s agenda that the leaked version has. And let us fast and pray for the Holy Father. Whether he knows it or not, the United Nations is going to do its best to use our Pope and his encyclical against the faithful.", "What is Real Estate For Life?\n\nReal Estate for Life donates vital funding to pro-life organizations through agent referrals at absolutely no cost to you.

Well, like anyone else, they would do it for self-interest. And what would their self-interest be? We all know the top two answers to that question: 1. a Palestinian state and 2. the advancement of Islam in America. The idea then was to advance blacks who would facilitate these two goals to positions of power in the Federal government, preferably, of course, the Presidency. And why would the Arabs target blacks in particular for this job? Well, for the same reason the early communists chose them as their vanguard for revolution (which literally means \u201cchange\u201d) in America. Allow me to quote Trotsky, in 1939: \u201cThe American Negroes, for centuries the most oppressed section of American society and the most discriminated against, are potentially the most revolutionary element of the population. They are designated by their historical past to be, under adequate leadership, the very vanguard of the proletarian revolution.\u201d Substitute the word \u201cIslam\u201d for the words \u201cthe proletarian revolution,\u201d and you most clearly get the picture, as Islam is a revolutionary movement just like communism is. (Trivia: it is from this very quote that Van Jones takes his name. Van is short for vanguard. He was born \u201cAnthony\u201d). In addition, long before 1979, blacks had become the vanguard of the spread of Islam in America, especially in prisons.\n\nInterestingly, in context with the fact that this article was written by her father-in-law, Valerie Jarrett has an unusual amount of influence over Obama (along with personal security that may be even better than the President\u2019s, another unusual and intriguing bit of business here). And equally interesting is that Obama, who may have been a beneficiary of this Muslim money, and may now be in this Muslim debt, has aggressively pursued both of the Muslim agendas I cited above. And, also equally interesting, is that Obama has paid a king\u2019s ransom for court ordered seals of any such records of this potential financing of his college education, and perhaps, of other of his expenses.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s very important to note that the main source for the article is Khalid Mansour, \u201cthe same lawyer who allegedly helped arrange for the entrance of Barack Obama into Harvard Law School in 1988.\u201d (Valerie Jarrett, by the way, was born in Iran. The one country protected by Obama from the sweep of the Arab Spring.) Now all of this may seem sensational, but let\u2019s face facts. What makes it most disturbing is that not only is it all logical, but it suddenly makes a lot of previously confusing things make perfect sense. \u2013 Pat Dollard\n\nExcerpted from Daily Interlake: Searching old newspapers is one of my favorite pastimes, and I have tried to use them many times to shed light on current events \u2014 or to inform readers about how the past is prologue to our very interesting present-day quandaries.\n\nRecently, I came across a syndicated column from November 1979 that seemed to point 30 years into the future toward an obscure campaign issue that arose briefly in the 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThough by no means definitive, it provides an interesting insight, at least, into how Chicago politics intersected with the black power movement and Middle Eastern money at a certain point in time. Whether it has any greater relevance to the 2012 presidential campaign, I will allow the reader to decide. In order to accomplish that, I will also take the unusual step of providing footnotes and the end of this column so that each of you can do the investigative work for yourself.\n\nThe column itself had appeared in the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Evening Independent of Nov. 6, but it was the work of a veteran newspaperman who at the time was working for the prestigious Chicago Tribune and whose work was syndicated nationally. (1)\n\nSo far as I know, this 1979 column has not previously been brought to light, but it certainly should be because it broke some very interesting news about the \u201crumored billions of dollars the oil-rich Arab nations are supposed to unload on American black leaders and minority institutions.\u201d The columnist quoted a black San Francisco lawyer who said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a rumor. Aid will come from some of the Arab states.\u201d\n\nWell, if anyone would know, it would have been this lawyer \u2014 Donald Warden, who had helped defend OPEC in an antitrust suit that year and had developed significant ties with the Saudi royal family since becoming a Muslim and taking the name Khalid Abdullah Tariq al-Mansour.\n\nAl-Mansour told Jarrett that he had presented the \u201cproposed special aid program to OPEC Secretary-General Rene Ortiz\u201d in September 1979, and that \u201cthe first indications of Arab help to American blacks may be announced in December.\u201d Maybe so, but I looked high and wide in newspapers in 1979 and 1980 for any other stories about this aid package funded by OPEC and never found it verified. (Continued)\n\nYou would think that a program to spend \u201c$20 million per year for 10 years to aid 10,000 minority students each year, including blacks, Arabs, Hispanics, Asians and native Americans\u201d would be referred to somewhere other than one obscure 1979 column, but I haven\u2019t found any other word of it.\n\nMaybe the funding materialized, maybe it didn\u2019t, but what\u2019s particularly noteworthy is that this black Islamic lawyer who \u201cfor several years [had] urged the rich Arab kingdoms to cultivate stronger ties to America\u2019s blacks by supporting black businesses and black colleges and giving financial help to disadvantaged students\u201d was also the same lawyer who allegedly helped arrange for the entrance of Barack Obama into Harvard Law School in 1988.\n\nThat tale had surfaced in 2008 when Barack Obama was a candidate for president and one of the leading black politicians in the country \u2014 Percy Sutton of New York \u2014 told an interviewer on a Manhattan TV news show that he had been introduced to Obama \u201cby a friend who was raising money for him. The friend\u2019s name is Dr. Khalid al-Mansour, from Texas. He is the principal adviser to one of the world\u2019s richest men. He told me about Obama.\u201d (2)\n\nThis peculiar revelation engendered a small hubbub in 2008, but was quickly dismissed by the Obama campaign as the ditherings of a senile old man. I don\u2019t believe President Obama himself ever denied the story personally, and no one has explained how Sutton came up with this elaborate story about Khalid al-Mansour if it had no basis in fact, and in any case al-Mansour no longer denies it. (3)\n\nBack in 2008, while actually supporting Hillary Clinton in the New York primary, Percy Sutton was interviewed on TV and said that he thought Barack Obama was nonetheless quite impressive. He also revealed that he had first heard about Obama 20 years previously in a letter where al-Mansour wrote, \u201cthere is a young man that has applied to Harvard. I know that you have a few friends up there because you used to go up there to speak. Would you please write a letter in support of him?\u201d\n\nSutton concluded in the interview, \u201cI wrote a letter of support of him to my friends at Harvard, saying to them I thought there was a genius that was going to be available and I certainly hoped they would treat him kindly.\u201d\n\nUntil now, there really has been no context within which to understand the Sutton story or to buttress it as a reliable account other than the reputation of Sutton himself as one of the top leaders of the black community in Manhattan \u2014 himself a noted attorney, businessman and politician. But the new discovery of the 1979 column that established Khalid al-Mansour\u2019s interest in creating a fund to give \u201cfinancial help to disadvantaged students\u201d does provide a clue that he might indeed \u2014 along with his patron, Arab Prince Alwaleed bin Talal \u2014 have taken an interest in the \u201cgenius\u201d Barack Obama.\n\nIt also might be considered more than coincidence that the author of that 1979 newspaper column was from Chicago, where Barack Obama settled in 1986 a few years after his stint at Columbia University. It is certainly surprising that the author of that column was none other than Vernon Jarrett, the future (and later former) father-in-law of Valerie Jarrett, who ultimately became the consigliatore of the Obama White House.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that Vernon Jarrett was one of the best friends and a colleague of Frank Marshall Davis, the former Chicago journalist and lifelong communist who moved to Hawaii in the late 1940s and years later befriended Stanley and Madelyn Dunham and their daughter Stanley Ann, the mother of Barack Obama. (4)\n\nAnd to anyone who has the modicum of a spark of curiosity, it is surely intriguing that Frank Davis took an active role in the rearing of young Barack from the age of 10 until he turned 18 and left Hawaii for his first year of college at Occidental College in Los Angeles. (5)\n\nIt is also at least suggestive that Obama began that college education as a member of the highly international student body of Occidental College in 1979, the same year when Vernon Jarrett was touting the college aid program being funded by OPEC and possibly Prince Alwaleed. The fact that President Obama has studiously avoided releasing records of his college years is suggestive also, but has no evidentiary value in the present discussion. (6)\n\nThe nature of Vernon Jarrett\u2019s relationship to Khalid al-Mansour is likewise uncertain, but it is very likely they had known each other as leaders of the black civil-rights movement for many years. Under his previous name of Donald Warden, al-Mansour had founded the African American Association in the Bay Area in the early 1960s. He had also helped inspire the Black Panther Party through his association with black-power leaders such as Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. Seale, of course, had a famous association with Chicago later, when he was part of the Chicago Eight charged with conspiracy and inciting to riot at the Democratic National Convention in 1968. (7)\n\nIn any case, it doesn\u2019t matter if Vernon Jarrett and Khalid al-Mansour had a personal relationship or not. For some reason, al-Mansour had used Jarrett as the messenger to get out the word about his efforts to funnel Arab oil money to black students and minority colleges at about the same time that Barack Obama began his college career. That doesn\u2019t mean either Jarrett or al-Mansour knew Obama at that time, but eight years later when Obama was a rising star in Chicago, a friend of Bill Ayers and Valerie Jarrett, it is much more likely that he did indeed have the assistance of very important people in his meteoric rise. The words of Percy Sutton about what al-Mansour told him regarding Obama certainly have the ring of truth:\n\n\u201cHis introduction was there is a young man that has applied to Harvard. I know that you have a few friends back there\u2026 Would you please write a letter in support of him? (That\u2019s before Obama decided to run.) \u2026 and he interjected the advice that Obama had passed the requirements, had taken and passed the requirements necessary to get into Harvard and become president of the Law Review. That\u2019s before he ever ran for anything.

We may never know, but Vernon Jarrett, back in 1979, thought that OPEC\u2019s intention to fund black and minority education would have huge political ramifications. As Jarrett wrote:\n\n\u201cThe question of financial aid from the Arabs could raise a few extremely interesting questions both inside and outside the black community. If such contributions are large and sustained, the money angle may become secondary to the sociology and politics of such an occurrence.\u201d (1)\n\nHe was, of course, right.\n\nAs Jarrett suggests, any black institutions and presumably individuals who became beholden to Arab money might be expected to continue the trend of American \u201cnew black advocacy for a homeland for the Palestinians\u201d and presumably for other Islamic and Arabic interests in the Middle East. For that reason, if for no other, the question of how President Obama\u2019s college education was funded is of considerably more than academic interest.\n\nVideo: Percy Sutton on Obama and Khalid Mansour", "", "What is Real Estate For Life?\n\nReal Estate for Life donates vital funding to pro-life organizations through agent referrals at absolutely no cost to you.

General Assembly in New York on Monday, Sept. 29, 2014. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 The Obama administration does not share Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s view that the forces of militant Islam, whether Sunni or Shi\u2019ite, have in common an ultimate goal \u201cto dominate the world,\u201d a State Department spokeswoman said Monday.\n\nIn a hard-hitting speech at the United Nations, the Israeli leader said that entities such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS/ISIL), Hamas, the Iranian regime, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda and Boko Haram share that eventual goal.\n\nJen Psaki was asked at the State Department daily briefing later whether the administration agreed with Netanyahu\u2019s argument that those various groups \u201care all part of the same kind of militant Muslim \u2013 Islamic attempt to rule the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would not agree with that characterization, no,\u201d she replied.\n\nAsked about Netanyahu\u2019s specific correlation of ISIS and Hamas, Psaki said that while both were U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, ISIS \u201cposes a different threat to Western interests and to the United States. And that\u2019s just a fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu or anyone else from Israel is suggesting that the United States launch a military campaign against Hamas, so we certainly \u2013 they are both designated terrorist organizations under the United States designations, but certainly we see differences in terms of the threat and otherwise.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Netanyahu said, \u201cYou know the famous American saying, \u2018All politics is local.\u2019 For the militant Islamists, \u2018All politics is global.\u2019 Because their ultimate goal is to dominate the world.\u201d\n\nHe said many of the countries supporting the effort against ISIS now, opposed Israel for confronting Hamas just weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThey evidently don\u2019t understand that ISIS and Hamas are branches of the same poisonous tree,\u201d he said. \u201cISIS and Hamas share a fanatical creed, which they both seek to impose well beyond the territory under their control.\u201d\n\nBeyond Hamas\u2019 immediate goal to destroy Israel, as laid out in its charter, Netanyahu said, it\u2019s broader objective was also the creation of a caliphate.\n\n\u201cHamas shares the global ambitions of its fellow militant Islamists. That\u2019s why its supporters wildly cheered in the streets of Gaza as thousands of Americans were murdered on 9/11. And that\u2019s why its leaders condemned the United States for killing Osama bin Laden, whom they praised as a holy warrior. So when it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that both ISIS and Hamas also had in common what \u201call militant Islamists share in common,\u201d whether al-Qaeda and its various affiliates, Boko Haram in Nigeria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, al-Shabaab in Somalia, al-Nusra in Syria or the Mahdi Army in Iraq.\n\n\u201cSome are radical Sunnis, some are radical Shi\u2019ites. Some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate from the 7th century, others want to trigger the apocalyptic return of an imam from the 9th century. They operate in different lands, they target different victims \u2013 and they even kill each other in their quest for supremacy,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\n\u201cBut they all share a fanatic ideology. They all seek to create ever expanding enclaves of militant Islam where there is no freedom and no tolerance \u2013 where women are treated as chattel, Christians are decimated, and minorities are subjugated, sometimes given the stark choice: convert or die.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu turned to Iran, highlighting its involvement in terrorism around the world in recent years, accusing President Hasan Rouhani of \u201cdoublespeak\u201d and warning against any negotiated deal with Tehran that would leave intact its \u201cnuclear military facilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war.\u201d\n\nPsaki said later Monday that the U.S. was confronting both the ISIS threat and the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran \u201cbecause we feel both are important.\u201d", "", "CancelDone Cropping Drag the corners of the box above to crop your new profile photo. Saving your new profile picture", "Throughout his career, Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky) has built upon his reputation as an independent maverick who is willing to buck party leadership or dogma to advance his goals for America. For conservatives dubious of the feckless GOP beltway bunch, this has been a refreshing change and helped the Kentucky Senator establish himself as a true contender for the 2016 Presidential nomination. While this trait is without doubt a positive one, Rand Paul\u2019s criticism of Republican\u2019s efforts to establish voter ID laws in various states is the wrong issue to tackle and counterproductive to the overall goals of increasing genuine dialogue with the black community.\n\nIn addition to his independence, Paul is to be legitimately commended for taking the lead in reaching out to African-American voters. His ideas on how we fight the drug war, sentencing and civil liberties are timely and come with reasoned solutions, rather than the sycophantic methods of the left. With his stance on voter ID laws however, he appears dangerously close to the pandering Democrats in gaining support by reinforcing red herring warnings of a society returning to the days of Jim Crow. Republicans, and in particular conservatives, certainly need to have open and honest discussions with the greater black community, but this is not the way to go about it.\n\nAt a recent gathering of Liberty PAC, a libertarian-leaning group, Paul was right to critique GOP appeal toward minorities when he noted, \u201cThe bottom line is, we aren\u2019t winning. We aren\u2019t winning because, its pretty simple, we don\u2019t have enough people in that group.\u201d In this regard he is absolutely correct, and the Republican Party is to be rightfully reproached in this. Despite being a party formed in large part as a direct result of the plight facing African-Americans, over the past 50 years the GOP has acquiesced the overall black vote to Democrats. This had been of dire consequence to both the Republican Party and black Americans as it has enabled a Progressive takeover of the Democratic Party and a disproportionate level of the negative impact of the Great Society to fall on the shoulders of the black community.\n\nThat Republicans previous failures at establish dialogue with black America, save a few standard election season efforts, have allowed Democrats to capture in upwards of 90 percent of African-American votes in many elections and gain near unanimous control of nearly every elected office in black communities. From City Council, to Alderman offices, congressional and state seats and most importantly (or rather devastatingly) local School Board seats. This has been the reality in America for going on 50 years now. This has come with a cost to the Republican Party, the black community and America as a whole. 50 years of Liberal-Progressive hegemony has in many ways reversed the historic progress black Americans have made on their American journey and have given back little, other than introduce the national culture to the terms \u201cbaby daddy.\u201d\n\nIn 1964 only 24 percent of all black children were born into single parent households, today that number stands at nearly 70 percent. Despite only encompassing 13 percent of the overall United States population, nearly half of all abortions performed are done on black women, 488,000 per year. If we include mothers of other races impregnated by black men, we are easily terminating the life of more than half a million black infants each and every year. These are numbers that even the leaders of the 20th century Klu Klux Klan would have thought to be impossible.\n\nDue to the inane and corrupt leadership of the Democrats in the inner-cities, economic opportunity is stalled, thus limiting the job prospects of black youths. With idle time on their hands, they have become fodder for the nefarious trappings of urban American life. As more and more entry-level jobs go to Democrats new favored voting bloc, Hispanic immigrants, legal and otherwise, millions upon millions of young black men have virtually given up on the traditional paths toward upward mobility and jump into the \u201chustlers life.\u201d Misplaced liberal sentiments of compassion for the criminal and restrictive urban gun laws for the law-abiding have further exacerbated the crime problems plaguing the good and honest folks in the black community, creating conditions that should never be tolerated in the greatest nation on earth.\n\nSo I ask with great sincerity Senator Paul, why embark on a course of dialogue which matches that of the opportunists we all know to be wicked. In playing the \u201crace card\u201d you lower yourself and divert attention away from the real problems facing African-Americans in lieu of emotional appeals that have dubious merit. As I pondered earlier in this piece, I will ask again, how many potential voters are truly going to be disenfranchised due to voter ID laws, particularly when state Republicans often include free identification programs when drafting these measures?\n\nI personally have challenged our party to place a greater emphasis on reaching out to minority voters and have previously commended Senator Paul\u2019s efforts in this regard. However, if we are going to do so by mimicking the strategy of the disingenuous left, and play off of historic fears and suspicions to do so, any gains we make in this area will be superficial and we will find ourselves becoming no better than Democrats. Indeed, let us as conservatives commit to increased open and honest dialogue with the black community at large, but by playing up the false argument that voter ID laws disenfranchise black voters, Rand Paul is stooping to a level that is both unproductive and unneeded. We have at our disposal 50 years of disastrous Democratic Party policy that is literally killing off African-Americans. Let us highlight these problems and counter with conservative ideas to rectify them, for a better black community, a better Republican Party and a better America.\n\nOpinion by Paul M Winters\n\nEditor in Chief, Dignitas News Service\n\nSources:\n\nBlackRepublicans (via YouTube)\n\nPolitico\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nStumbleUpon\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Learn more", "Massive media publicity over mass shootings in the last year have brought gun control back to the forefront in the U.S. Banning so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d and \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are all the rage. Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63). This doesn\u2019t mean that it is unlimited, the same as all rights (more on that below). However, the court states that even though gun violence is a problem to be taken seriously, \u201cthe enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table\u201d (p.64).\n\n6. The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this. It\u2019s listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (\u201csecurity of a free state\u201d), then the people need arms: \u201cWhen the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny\u201d (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted \u201cthat history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents\u201d (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: \u201cduring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive\u201d (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens\u2019 militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).\n\n7. The Second Amendment was also meant as a provision to repel a foreign army invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find this one comical, but it\u2019s in there. The court notes one of many reasons for the militia to ensure a free state was \u201cit is useful in repelling invasions\u201d (p.24). This provision, like tyranny, isn\u2019t an everyday occurring use of the right; more like a once-in-a-century (if that) kind of provision. A popular myth from World War II holds Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese navy allegedly said \u201cYou cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\u201d Although there is no evidence of him saying this, there was concern that Japan might invade during WWII. Japan did invade Alaska, which was a U.S. territory at the time, and even today on the West Coast there are still gun embankments from the era (now mostly parks). The fact is that there are over 310 million firearms in the United States as of 2009, making a foreign invasion success less likely (that, and the U.S. military is arguably the strongest in the world).\n\n8. The Second Amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t unlimited: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d (p. 54). The Court upheld restrictions like the prohibition of arms by felons and the mentally ill, and carrying in certain prohibited places like schools and courthouses. What is protected are weapons \u201cin common use of the time\u201d (p.55). This doesn\u2019t mean weapons in common use \u201cat that time,\u201d meaning the 18th Century. The Court said the idea that it would is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\u201d (p.8). The Court\u2019s criteria includes weapons in popular widespread use \u201cthat [are] overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d (p. 56), and \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans\u201d (p. 58).\n\n9. The Second Amendment might require full-blown military arms to fulfill the original intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court didn\u2019t rule specifically on this in D.C. v. Heller, but noting that weapon technology has drastically changed (mentioning modern day bombers and tanks), they stated \u201cthe conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large\u201d (p. 55).\n\nThey further added that \u201cthe fact that modern developments [in modern weaponry] have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right\u201d (p. 56). A full ruling has not been made, as this was not in the scope the court was asked to rule on in the D.C. v. Heller case, but they left the door open for future ruling.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Feb 8, 2013.

Learn more", "Massive media publicity over mass shootings in the last year have brought gun control back to the forefront in the U.S. Banning so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d and \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are all the rage. Calls have been made for an honest national dialogue that puts every option on the table. An honest conversation ought to look at as complete of a picture as possible so we can correctly assess \u201cjust how big of an issue is it?\u201d\n\nTo adequately evaluate this question, we should examine how many homicides there are in the U.S. overall, compared to homicides from firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns), compared to homicides from rifles only (in which so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d would fall), and homicides that occur in mass shootings. We ought to further compare homicides to other causes of death to get a comparative indication of the magnitude of each compared to other public health risks that cause death in the U.S. This will help us understand the relative significance of the issue.\n\nTotal U.S. homicides: The total number of homicides in the U.S., reported by the FBI, is about 12,000-13,000 annually. Generally, this has trended downward since the early 1990s and 1980s, which saw several years with homicides ranging from 21,000-24,000 homicides. In 2010, the last year available, the number was 12,996. In 2009, it was 13,752.\n\nFirearm homicides: Out of the total homicides, about 2/3 are committed with firearms, 1/3 from other causes. We\u2019ll look at both. In 2010, firearm homicides were 8,775, or 67.5% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 9,199, or 66.8% of all homicides.\n\nRifle homicides: The FBI reports the total number of rifle homicides is about 350 annually the last couple of years. This includes bolt-action rifles, as well as semi-automatic rifles and so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d There is a separate category for shotguns, so they are not included in this number. In 2010, the number of rifle homicides was 358, or 2.75% of all homicides. In 2009, the number was 351, or 2.55% of all homicides.\n\nMass shooting homicides: Pop-media classification of \u201cmass murder\u201d varies. For instance, CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan and The Nation cite shootings in which only 1 or 2 homicides occur. However, the FBI defines mass murder as 4 or more killed.\n\nIn 2012, there were either 81 or 88 murdered in mass shootings, depending on your source. Less than 100 no matter, which source, is used. So if we assume high at 100 homicides from mass murder and assume low at 12,000 annual homicides that means that mass murders account for 0.0083 of all homicides, or a fraction of 1%.\n\nPersonal weapon homicides: FBI data shows that \u201cpersonal\u201d weapon homicides, which is defined by hands/feet (beating someone to death) are 7-800 annually. In 2010, it was 745; in 2009, 817. This is more than double all rifle homicides. It is more than 7 or 8 times the number of mass murder homicides.\n\nCompared to other causes of death \u2014 public health & safety issues: Motor vehicle deaths: There are between 32-42,000 deaths from vehicle collisions every year. This dwarfs both homicides firearm homicides easily. When compared just to rifle homicides at ~ 350, motor vehicle deaths is massive & rifle homicides is minuscule. Unintentional injury deaths: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 118,021 accidental deaths in 2009, the last year reported. Compared to this mass murder again appears relatively insignificant in terms of loss of life and public health concern. Accidental fall deaths: 2009 saw 24,792 accidental fall deaths. This accounts for 247 times the number of mass murder deaths. Others reported by CDC: Drug-induced deaths \u2013 39,147\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths \u2013 24,518\n\nAccidental poisoning \u2013 31,758 Choking: There are approximately 4,600 choking deaths every year. That\u2019s 46 times the number of mass murder deaths. Children\u2019s choking deaths number 1825, or more than 18 times the total number of mass murder deaths. Bambi: According to the Insurance Journal, 200 people were killed by hitting deer with their cars. That\u2019s more than double the number of mass murder deaths. These cited statistics provide a mountain of data from credible sources that clearly provides a good comparison by which we can evaluate mass murder homicides within a complete picture of U.S. homicides as well as provide a means to compare homicides and mass murder to other causes of death that affect public health and safety concerns. When you evaluate the broader picture of public health causes of death, and even within homicides as its own category, mass murder looks pretty insignificant.

The Second Amendment codifies a pre-existing right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t grant or create rights; it recognizes and protects rights that inherently exist. This is why the Founders used the word \u201cunalienable\u201d previously in the Declaration of Independence; these rights cannot be created or taken away. In D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment \u201ccodified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \u201cshall not be infringed \u2026 this is not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d (p. 19).\n\n2. The Second Amendment protects individual, not collective rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \u201cmilitia\u201d has created some confusion in modern times, because we don\u2019t understand the language as it was used at the time the Constitution was written. However, the Supreme Court states in context, \u201cit was clearly an individual right\u201d (p. 20). The operative clause of the Second Amendment is \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\u201d which is used three times in the Bill of Rights. The Court explains that \u201cAll three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \u2018collective\u2019 rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body\u201d (p. 5), adding \u201cnowhere else in the Constitution does a \u2018right\u2019 attributed to \u201cthe people\u201d refer to anything other than an individual right\u201d (p. 6).\n\n3. Every citizen is the militia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further clarify regarding the use of the word \u201cmilitia,\u201d the court states \u201cthe ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men\u201d (p. 23). Today we would say it is all citizens, not necessarily just men. The Court explains: \u201c\u2019Keep arms\u2019 was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else\u201d (p. 9). Since the militia is all of us, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201conly carrying a weapon in an organized military unit\u201d (p. 11-12). \u201cIt was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia\u201d (p. 20).\n\n4. Personal self-defense is the primary purpose of the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often hear politicians talk about their strong commitment to the Second Amendment while simultaneously mentioning hunting. Although hunting is a legitimate purpose for firearms, it isn\u2019t the primary purpose for the Second Amendment. The Court states \u201cthe core lawful purpose [is] self-defense\u201d (p. 58), explaining the Founders \u201cunderstood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves \u2026 the \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019 as permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury\u2019 (p.21). They conclude \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d (p.56).\n\n5. There is no interest-balancing approach to the Second Amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-balancing means we balance a right with other interests. The court notes that we don\u2019t interpret rights this way stating \u201cwe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all\u201d (p.62-63). This doesn\u2019t mean that it is unlimited, the same as all rights (more on that below). However, the court states that even though gun violence is a problem to be taken seriously, \u201cthe enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table\u201d (p.64).\n\n6. The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this. It\u2019s listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (\u201csecurity of a free state\u201d), then the people need arms: \u201cWhen the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny\u201d (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted \u201cthat history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people\u2019s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents\u201d (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: \u201cduring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive\u201d (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens\u2019 militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).\n\n7. The Second Amendment was also meant as a provision to repel a foreign army invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find this one comical, but it\u2019s in there. The court notes one of many reasons for the militia to ensure a free state was \u201cit is useful in repelling invasions\u201d (p.24). This provision, like tyranny, isn\u2019t an everyday occurring use of the right; more like a once-in-a-century (if that) kind of provision. A popular myth from World War II holds Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese navy allegedly said \u201cYou cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\u201d Although there is no evidence of him saying this, there was concern that Japan might invade during WWII. Japan did invade Alaska, which was a U.S. territory at the time, and even today on the West Coast there are still gun embankments from the era (now mostly parks). The fact is that there are over 310 million firearms in the United States as of 2009, making a foreign invasion success less likely (that, and the U.S. military is arguably the strongest in the world).\n\n8. The Second Amendment protects weapons \u201cin common use at the time\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms isn\u2019t unlimited: \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited\u201d (p. 54). The Court upheld restrictions like the prohibition of arms by felons and the mentally ill, and carrying in certain prohibited places like schools and courthouses. What is protected are weapons \u201cin common use of the time\u201d (p.55). This doesn\u2019t mean weapons in common use \u201cat that time,\u201d meaning the 18th Century. The Court said the idea that it would is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that \u201cthe Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\u201d (p.8). The Court\u2019s criteria includes weapons in popular widespread use \u201cthat [are] overwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d (p. 56), and \u201cthe most popular weapon chosen by Americans\u201d (p. 58).\n\n9. The Second Amendment might require full-blown military arms to fulfill the original intent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Court didn\u2019t rule specifically on this in D.C. v. Heller, but noting that weapon technology has drastically changed (mentioning modern day bombers and tanks), they stated \u201cthe conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty.

It\u2019s Islamophobia!!!\n\nBut wait\u2026 what if\u2026 he didn\u2019t actually build any clock?!\n\nFrom AV Artvoice Blog:\n\nI\u2019m an electronics geek. I was interested in the clock! I wanted to figure out what he had come up with. I found the highest resolution photograph of the clock I could. Instantly, I was disappointed. Somewhere in all of this \u2013 there has indeed been a hoax. Ahmed Mohamed didn\u2019t invent his own alarm clock. He didn\u2019t even build a clock. Now, before I go on and get accused of attacking a 14 year old kid who\u2019s already been through enough, let me explain my purpose. I don\u2019t want to just dissect the clock. I want to dissect our reaction as a society to the situation. Part of that is the knee-jerk responses we\u2019re all so quick to make without facts. So, before you scroll down and leave me angry comments, please continue to the end (or not \u2013 prove my point, and miss the point, entirely!) For starters, one glance at the printed circuit board in the photo, and I knew we were looking at mid-to-late 1970s vintage electronics. Surely you\u2019ve seen a modern circuit board, with metallic traces leading all over to the various components like an electronic spider\u2019s web. You\u2019ll notice right away the highly accurate spacing, straightness of the lines, consistency of the patterns. That\u2019s because we design things on computers nowadays, and computers assist in routing these lines. Take a look at the board in Ahmed\u2019s clock. It almost looks hand-drawn, right? That\u2019s because it probably was. Computer aided design was in its infancy in the 70s. This is how simple, low cost items (like an alarm clock) were designed. Today, even a budding beginner is going to get some computer aided assistance \u2013 in fact they\u2019ll probably start there, learning by simulating designs before building them.\n\nNow, the blogger continues to show that basically what Ahmed did is buy an old clock, rip out it\u2019s insides, stuff it into another box, and take off to school.\n\nSo I turned to eBay, searching for vintage alarm clocks. It only took a minute to locate Ahmed\u2019s clock. See this eBay listing, up at the time of this writing. Amhed\u2019s clock was invented, and built, by Micronta, a Radio Shack subsidary. Catalog number 63 756. The shape and design is a dead give away. The large screen. The buttons on the front laid out horizontally would have been on a separate board \u2013 a large snooze button, four control buttons, and two switches to turn the alarm on and off, and choose two brightness levels. A second board inside would have contained the actual \u201cbrains\u201d of the unit. The clock features a 9v battery back-up, and a switch on the rear allows the owner to choose between 12 and 24 hour time. (Features like a battery back-up, and a 24 hour time selection seems awful superfluous for a hobby project, don\u2019t you think?) Oh, and about that \u201cM\u201d logo on the circuit board mentioned above? Micronta.\n\nSooooo\u2026. what happened here? The blogger draws some conclusions:\n\nSo there you have it folks, Ahmed Mohamad did not invent, nor build a clock. He took apart an existing clock, and transplanted the guts into a pencil box, and claimed it was his own creation. It all seems really fishy to me. If we accept the story about \u201cinventing\u201d an alarm clock is made up, as I think I\u2019ve made a pretty good case for, it\u2019s fair to wonder what other parts of the story might be made up, not reported factually by the media, or at least, exaggerated. I refer back again to this YouTube video interview with Ahmed. He explains that he closed up the box with a piece of cord because he didn\u2019t want it to look suspicious. I\u2019m curious, why would \u201clooking suspicious\u201d have even crossed his mind before this whole event unfolded, if he was truly showing off a hobby project, something so innocuous as an alarm clock. Why did he choose a pencil box, one that looks like a miniature briefcase no less, as an enclosure for a clock? It\u2019s awful hard to see the clock with the case closed. On the other hand, with the case open, it\u2019s awful dangerous to have an exposed power transformer sitting near the snooze button (unless, perhaps his invention was to stop serial-snooze-button pressers by giving them a dangerous electrical shock!)\n\nNow I think it\u2019s a real leap in logic to believe this was all an elaborate CAIR planned hoax. They would have done it better if it was. What it seems like is this dumb kid did this as a joke, got caught, and it was taken WAYY too far, and the easiest way to get out of it was to claim racism, or Islamophobia.\n\nAnd the proof of this, is that he really didn\u2019t invent the clock.\n\nAlso Obama is an idiot.\n\nUPDATE!!!

As I said, you\u2019ll forgive me if I\u2019m not moved by yet another false show of \u201cmoral outrage.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s talk about lies. This amendment was supposed to close the so-called \u201cgun show loophole.\u201d There is no such \u201cloophole.\u201d The amendment was also supposed to close the \u201conline loophole.\u201d This is an even bolder of a lie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president had falsely claimed that \u201cup to 40%\u201d of guns are bought without a background check via the so-called \u201cgun show loophole,\u201d for which the Washington Post Fact-Checker gave him two \u201cPinocchios\u201d (update: upped to three pinocchios) for being misleading. This false claim comes from a 1994 study of 251 people from before the Brady Bill required Federal Firearms Licensed (FFL) retail sellers to run background checks on all sales. The Washington Post reconnected with the original study authors who informed them the actual range is 14-22% with a +/- error margin of 6%, meaning the final range is 8-28%. That\u2019s nowhere near 40%. Also, factor in that it was before the Brady Bill was passed and it was from 1994. According to the ATF, federal law requires FFL holders to run a background check on all sales no matter where they are, retail storefront, and gun show, what have you. Failure to do so is already a crime.\n\nWhat about private sales? Private sales are from any private citizen who does not hold a FFL. These are, and have been since before the beginning of time, been 100% legal to another private, non-FFL holding person. Technically, the law states that if someone knowingly transfers a gun to a prohibited person (felon, mentally ill, etc.) they are breaking the law. But if you are not knowingly selling a firearm to such a person, you are not breaking the law. What about location? Does it matter if the private sale is in your driveway, parking lot, swap meet, gun show, or back alley? Nope. Private sale is private sale, regardless of whether there happen to be FFL\u2019s at the next table, or in the next county. Ostensibly, the concern is that continuing to \u201callow\u201d the \u201cinbred, non-showering, redneck hicks\u201d that attend gun shows the \u201cprivilege\u201d of selling their private property at gun shows is that crazed mass killers and terrorists are going to frequent gun shows to get fully automatic machine guns only to drive to the nearest mall or Kindergarten class with 2,000 rounds of ammunition and go out with a blaze of hellfire on our innocent hindquarters. This is pure fairy tale. The Department of Justice studies of where felons acquire their firearms show that less than 1% get them from gun shows. The majority \u2014 nearly 80% \u2014 of them gets them from (already) illegal transfer via family/friends, or from the black market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe myth about the online loophole is a clever-ish sort of new lie perpetrated by anti-gunners. To listen to them, you\u2019d think one could hop onto Amazon.com or some sort of \u201cGuns-R-Us.com,\u201d and order your made-for-mass-murder killing machine sent via UPS to your front door. Pure hogwash. There are plenty of online gun retailers, but none of them will ship you personally a gun; it must go to a FFL retailer who then must run a background check on you. Failure to do so is a crime. They are retailers, not black market underworld kingpins; they\u2019re in business to make money, not go to prison for yours or my sake. These retailers only ship guns to FFL holders. Not to mention that they themselves hold FFLs and must comply with the law governing retail sales regardless of location.\n\nWhat about private sales conducted online via classifieds? This is a little trickier. For one, many places like Craigslist, don\u2019t allow guns sales. But for classified ad sites that do allow them, this is no different than placing a classified ad in your local newspaper. It is, and always has been 100% legal. All the same rules discussed above still apply. If shipping out of state, it must go to an FFL; failure to do so is already a crime. If sold locally, there are no restrictions as has always been the case. If the president and gun control advocates wanted to refer to closing all \u201cprivate\u201d sales, and be honest about the fact that you\u2019re changing the law. Don\u2019t call it a \u201cloophole;\u201d which as I wrote previously, calling something a \u201cloophole\u201d that was never illegal to begin with, and doesn\u2019t involve \u201cgetting around\u201d something on a technicality, is itself a war waged with words and dishonest political gamesmanship. Gun control advocates might garner more support and sympathy if they didn\u2019t rely on lies to make their case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the president acts as if the Senate just guaranteed another mass shooting (though even Vice President Biden admits their anti-gun efforts won\u2019t prevent another mass shooting). The truth is that this amendment failed to address any of the issues inherently existent in our current system: failure to fund NICS (the background check system), failure of many states to report mental health and felony data to NICS, failure to address straw man purchases, failure to enforce and prosecute illegal transfer and background check fraud. And it fails to address the black market, illegal weapons trafficking (which is done by trans-national gangs according to the FBI), and theft \u2013 including targeted theft of police and military equipment.\n\nThe greatest lie of all is that this amendment would have done anything to decrease homicides or prevent another great tragedy. The decision to engage in lies and propaganda in lieu of actually addressing the underlying causes of violence and homicide in the U.S. is the real tragedy. That\u2019s what Obama and other politicians like him ought to be ashamed of.\n\nThis article was originally published on PolicyMic.com, now Mic.com. Original publish date Apr 23, 2013.

House and Senate leadership and staff are working to iron out differences on the two chambers\u2019 budget blueprints, and expect to complete this process by mid-April.\n\nThe federal budget process has completely broken down in Washington. Rolling appropriations bills together into one massive package under the threat of government shut-down is concerning because it doesn\u2019t allow for close scrutiny of where taxpayer dollars are going. Congress and the President should adhere to the budget deadlines they are legally required to follow, including submitting budgets on time and considering appropriations bills separately and fully.\n\n*A bipartisan vote came to pass in the House on March 25, 2015. A day later, the Senate voted to permanently eliminate the Death Tax in a vote on March 26, 2015.\n\nThe Death Tax is one of the most unpopular taxes in the code, and Congress has not voted on it in a decade. Repealing the Death Tax would encourage people to save and invest, knowing that the federal government would not seize nearly half of their estate when they die\u2013 and more importantly, it would prevent the government from treating death as a taxable event.\n\nBring American Profits Home\n\nThe United States is currently the only developed economy that uses a worldwide tax system. Under this system, income earned abroad is taxed at both the host-country rate, and then subjected to U.S. taxes as well when it is brought home. This uncompetitive tax system has led to two outcomes.\n\nFirst U.S companies are sitting on nearly $2 trillion dollars of income \u201cparked\u201d overseas that they are unwilling to bring back to the U.S. because of the built-in tax disincentive. Second, many companies are seeking \u201cinversions,\u201d an approach where they acquire or are acquired by a foreign company in order to put their billions of dollars overseas to productive use rather than forfeiting a large chunk of it in taxes.\n\nAllowing for tax-free repatriation of U.S. profits will help boost investment in U.S. jobs and growth, and reverse the perverse incentive of the current U.S. tax code that rewards companies for foreign job creation and mergers over investment in America and American workers.\n\n*While the budget resolutions approved by the House and Senate both contained placeholders for tax reform, no straight up or down votes have been held in either chamber. President Obama\u2019s views these overseas profits as a potential source of revenue, however, and has already announced his intention to subject them to a tax as part of a plan to underwrite additional infrastructure spending.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Alexis\u2019 family members also confirmed to the press that he was being \u201ctreated\u201d for his mental health problems. Across the medical industry, \u201ctreatment\u201d is the code word for psychiatric drugging.\u201d\n\nAlexis also suffered from PTSD, blackouts and anger issues \u2013 all of which are treated with SSRI drugs. The most common form of treatment for PTSD is Paroxetine, which is listed as the number 3 top violence-causing drug by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP).\n\nThe Navy Yard shooter was clearly on some form of psychiatric drug, but the media has shown no interest in discovering its identity.\n\nDespite it being reported that prescription drugs were found in the apartment of \u2018Batman\u2019 shooter James Holmes days after the Aurora massacre, it took nine months to find out exactly what those drugs were. Like Columbine killer Eric Harris, Holmes had been taking Zoloft, another SSRI drug linked with violent outbursts.\n\nThe length of time it took to find out that Holmes was on Zoloft was partly because the media habitually shows zero interest in pursuing the link between anti-depressants and violence.\n\nAs the website SSRI Stories profusely documents, there are literally hundreds of examples of mass shootings, murders and other violent episodes that have been committed by individuals on psychiatric drugs over the past three decades. The number of cases is staggering.\n\nWhy is the corporate media so disinterested in pursuing this clear connection?\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with the fact that the pharmaceutical giants who produce drugs like Zoloft, Prozac and Paxil spend around $2.4 billion dollars a year on direct-to-consumer television advertising every year. By running negative stories about prescription drugs, networks risk losing tens of millions of dollars in ad revenue.\n\nWhile failing to ask questions about what SSRI drugs Aaron Alexis was taking prior to his rampage, the media instead blamed the shooting on assault rifles, even after it had been confirmed that no AR-15 was used by Alexis during the massacre.\n\nFBI assistant director Victoria Parlave stated at a press conference on Tuesday that authorities, \u201cdo not have any information at this time that [Alexis] had an AR-15 in his possession.\u201d\n\nDespite there being no evidence that an AR-15 was used, the New York Daily News ran a front page headline yesterday morning entitled, \u201cSame Gun Different Slay,\u201d next to a picture of an assault rifle.\n\nHours after the FBI stated that no AR-15 had been used, MSNBC\u2019s Alex Wagner, who previously blamed the Boston bombings on Alex Jones, continued to use an animated graphic depicting Alexis carrying an assault rifle during the massacre.\n\nAnti-second amendment crusader Piers Morgan also erroneously blamed the shooting on \u201ca man with a legally purchased AR-15, who just committed the same kind of atrocity as we saw at Sandy Hook, and Aurora,\u201d during his CNN show on Monday.\n\nCNN\u2019s live news coverage also reported that Alexis had \u201crecently purchased (an) AR-15 shotgun,\u201d when in fact that purchase had been denied.\n\nBoth the New York Times and the Washington Post also falsely reported that an AR-15 had been found on Alexis after the massacre.\n\nD.C. gun grabbers Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin also regurgitated the false claim that Alexis used an AR-15 during the rampage.\n\nThe U.S. press has once again behaved like state media in the aftermath of the Navy Yard shooting by pursuing the assault rifle angle \u2013 despite the fact that it was patently false \u2013 in order to bolster the White House\u2019s gun control agenda.\n\nIn doing so, they have concurrently buried an integral aspect of mass shootings that needs to be highlighted as part of a national conversation \u2013 the clear connection between violent outbursts and SSRI drugs.\n\nFacebook @ https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71\n\nFOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson @ https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet\n\n*********************\n\nPaul Joseph Watson is the editor and writer for Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.

Police put him in handcuffs and, even after the confusion passed, the boy was suspended from school.\n\nThat earned Mohamed a planned trip to the White House, a message of support from Hillary Clinton, an offer to stop by Facebook to meet Mark Zuckerberg and an invitation to be an intern at Twitter.\n\nThe police overreacted. Yet the device did look like something Ethan Hunt would lob out of a helicopter at the last minute in \u201cMission: Impossible.\u201d As National Review\u2019s Charles Cooke pointed out on Twitter, the scary-looking tangle of wires \u201clooks a lot more like a bomb than a pop tart looks like a gun.\u201d\n\nJosh Welch, a white Maryland kid with ADHD who was 7 years old when he was kicked out of school for chewing a Pop-Tart into the shape of a pistol and pretending to shoot other students with it, must be puzzled.\n\nWhere\u2019s his White House invitation? Where\u2019s his chance to start networking at Facebook? His parents were forced to hire a lawyer and spent a year and a half just trying to get the suspension erased from the kid\u2019s record. They were repeatedly refused.\n\n\u201cI stand with Ahmed, too. But I also stand with Alex Stone,\u201d noted Reason writer Robby Soave. Alex Stone, a 16-year-old white kid from Summerville, SC, wrote a short story in which he imagined using a gun to kill a dinosaur. For this his locker was searched and he was arrested, handcuffed, charged with \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d and suspended from school for three days.\n\nObviously the White House and Mark Zuckerberg couldn\u2019t be bothered to comment, but you\u2019d think that, at the very least, Stephen King would have sent out a tweet expressing outrage that imagination was being punished.\n\nNada.\n\nIn Dyer County, Tenn., Kendra Turner says she was suspended for saying, \u201cBless you\u201d after a student sneezed, and that her teacher told her that she would have no \u201cgodly speaking in class.\u201d\n\nA school administrator said, \u201cThis was not a religious issue at all, but more of an issue the teacher felt was a distraction in her class.\u201d Uh-huh. School leadership offered no explanation for the photos posted by students that showed \u201cbless you\u201d on a list of expressions banned in the classroom. Turner is still waiting for her call from President Obama.\n\nAre white kids being punished en masse for dopey quasi-infractions because of their race? Of course not. That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nBut it\u2019s equally absurd to suggest that you have to be Muslim, or brown-skinned, or live in Texas, to be subjected to overenthusiastic use of school discipline and police force.\n\n\u201cIt never would have happened to a white kid\u201d? It happens to white kids all. The. Time.\n\nThe main difference between the Ahmed Mohamed case and the others is that the mainstream media and the leftist point of view it presents just can\u2019t let go of Ahmed. Ahmed is too useful to their narrative to be a one-day story.\n\nThat Bristol Palin said on Facebook that President Obama didn\u2019t need to get involved in the situation proved irresistible for the media, which loves to depict America as a bitter standoff between red-state hicks on the one hand and sophisticated members of the cool bicoastal techno-media club on the other.\n\nLet\u2019s just savor for a moment that the musings of the daughter of an unemployed former governor constitute national news. This year the brother of a sitting president made derogatory comments about the leader of the free world and the reaction from the media was crickets.\n\nMalik Obama gets the courtesy of being ignored because he has also said some crazy things. Now imagine Bristol Palin making loony statements. Would the media decline to cover them?\n\nFor 14 years and two weeks now, the left has been desperate to find some evidence, any evidence, that Muslims in general are facing deep-seated discrimination because a few Muslims attacked us on 9/11.\n\nThat American Muslims have instead mostly been treated with respect and courtesy ought to be a point of pride, but at no point will the left ever say, \u201cIsn\u2019t it great that we\u2019re such a pluralistic and tolerant country?\u201d\n\nThe left-led push to turn a man who was, as of 2004, an obscure state senator with no particular accomplishments, into the president four years later, was centrally and crucially about race. Everyone else was being subjected to a bait-and-switch.\n\nInstead of being credited with enlightenment for being the only white-majority country ever to elect a black leader, now we\u2019re told that everything is about racism.", "Add a location to your Tweets\n\nWhen you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.
