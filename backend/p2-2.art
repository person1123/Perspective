Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:"], ["http://linkis.com/www.youtube.com/hgTdr", "Rachel Maddow: BERNIE Sanders,\u201cRepublicans Get Away with MURDER!\u201d", "Linkis.com is showing you the most important part of the page.

It was more like Darkness at Noon. Jeb Bush did call for the party to embrace a Reaganesque sense of optimism, which he contrasted with \u201cthe Donald Trump approach of \u2018Everything is bad, everything is coming to an end.\u201d But with occasional exceptions, usually involving the softer-edged John Kasich, the Trump approach dominated. For five hours, the candidates stood in front of Reagan\u2019s plane and described America as a declining nation in a dystopic world, as they pledged, to borrow a phrase, to Make America Great Again.\n\nThe big question of 2016 could well be whether Americans agree with the Republican portrait of Obama-era malaise. It was taken for granted last night that the national debt is out of control, the economy is deteriorating, the government is corrupt, and the world, as Lindsey Graham put it, is \u201con fire.\u201d Rubio complained that \u201cour left-wing government is undermining all the institutions that support the family.\u201d Ted Cruz declared that the Iran nuclear deal would turn the Obama administration into the world\u2019s largest financier of Islamic terror. Chris Christie said the middle class \u201cis getting plowed over by Barack Obama.\u201d The one thing the Republicans didn\u2019t seem too concerned about was climate change, which they agreed was not a problem worthy of solutions that might increase utility bills at a time when average Americans, as Rick Santorum put it, \u201care losing ground.\u201d\n\nObama provided an alternative view yesterday before the debate, making the case before the Business Roundtable that \u201cAmerica\u2019s great right now.\u201d He later tweeted some supporting evidence that wasn\u2019t mentioned last night on CNN: U.S. businesses have added 13 million jobs over 66 straight months of employment growth, with the jobless rate dropping from 10% to 5%. The budget deficit has fallen from nearly 10% of GDP to less than 3% under Obama, while the uninsured rate has fallen from 15.4% to 9.2% under Obamacare. The U.S. auto industry, on the brink of extinction before Obama\u2019s bailout, is on pace for its best year since 2001.\n\nBut last night wasn\u2019t really about evidence, although several candidates did mention that wages are stagnant, and Bush noted the \u201clabor participation rate\u201d has been declining since 1977. There was a consensus on stage that illegal immigration is a national crisis\u2014an \u201cincredible problem,\u201d said Ben Carson\u2014even though the population of undocumented immigration has actually declined by about 1 million under Obama. Carson also bemoaned how little has been done to push oil independence; in fact, oil imports from the Middle East just hit a 28-year low. Listening to Graham, Rubio and Fiorina decrying the weakness of the military and the need for a much larger navy, a listener never would have guessed that the U.S. spends five times as much as any other country on defense.\n\nThere was some debate about the Iraq War, and Trump mentioned the financial cataclysm of 2008, but some of the candidates openly pined for the good old days of George W. Bush. It wasn\u2019t just Jeb who credited his brother with keeping the country safe; Christie added that Obama had stripped away that safety, even though the September 11 attacks were on Bush\u2019s watch, and nothing similar has happened since. Fiorina actually seemed to suggest the economy was better when Lehman Brothers was collapsing in September 2008, suggesting that \u201cin seven short years the president has stolen our belief that our children will have a better future.\u201d\n\nThe doom and gloom was especially intense around foreign affairs, with general agreement that, as Jeb Bush put it, \u201cthis administration has created insecurity the likes of which we never could have imagined.\u201d Rubio threw around words like \u201capocalyptic\u201d to describe the danger of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal. There were numerous references to the danger that ISIS poses to the American homeland. Trump asked why no one seemed to be worrying about the North Korean threat.\n\n\u201cThis world,\u201d he summed up, \u201cis a mess.\u201d\n\nIn this woe-a-thon, it was interesting to hear Kasich talk about his desire to give people \u201ca sense of hope, a sense of unity, a sense we can do it,\u201d he said. He sounded more genuinely Reaganesque than Bush, who talks about running a joyful campaign the way unhappy people often telling their friends how happy they are.\n\nBut for now, the Republican Party is Trump\u2019s party, and it was amusing to watch also-rans like Bobby Jindal try to play Trump on TV. Jindal described an America where illegal immigration is a national nightmare, where anti-Christian discrimination is a national epidemic, and the Republican Party\u2014which has failed to defund Planned Parenthood or block the Iran Deal\u2014is a national disgrace.\n\nOn that last point, at least, Obama probably agrees."], ["http://www.joemygod.com/2015/09/16/donald-trump-hold-fundraiser-for-fake-veterans-group-which-is-really-just-one-guy-video/", "Donald Trump Holds Fundraiser For Fake Veterans Group Which Is Really Just One Guy [VIDEO]", "Yesterday Donald Trump held a fundraiser for a veterans group on the deck of the USS Iowa in California.

But Mamet\u2019s book also offers some shrewd observations on politics and serves as a useful tool for understanding the rise, and potential fall, of Donald Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, during the Republican Presidential debate on CNN, Trump was exposed as ignorant of basic policy details (he was a bystander during the foreign-policy exchanges), boorish (he refused to apologize to Columba Bush for saying that her background influenced Jeb\u2019s allegedly permissive views on undocumented immigrants), and he seemed\u2014no other way to put it\u2014\u201clow energy\u201d as the debate dragged on into its third hour. (As my colleague Amy Davidson put it, \u201che seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake.\u201d) Political observers then spent the day after the debate ruminating on whether we may be witnessing the beginning of Trump\u2019s decline, and whether his fate will look similar to that of the five Republican candidates\u2014Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum\u2014who all experienced similar polling surges in the 2012 G.O.P. Presidential contest, before Republican voters wised up and picked Mitt Romney.\n\nWhy did Trump\u2019s support shoot up to an average of almost thirty-five per cent in national polls? The (boring) political-science answer is that Trump\u2019s support was a function of his news coverage. His rise correlates perfectly with the amount of attention he received from the media. When voters, most of whom don\u2019t pay close attention to politics, are asked to choose from a long list of names, a third mention the one that they\u2019ve heard in the news most recently or most frequently.\n\nBut that explanation seems to leave a lot out. Why does the media cover Trump so much? Are voters, especially \u201cthe likely voters\u201d who are often polled, really that passive and ignorant? Why did they express increasingly positive views of him, as measured by favorability ratings, as the summer of Trump rolled on? How did Trump seize our attention?\n\nHe did it by stepping onto the summer stage in a way that none of his rivals did. The other Republican candidates spent 2015 attending to the traditional business of the so-called invisible primary: hiring staff, studying up on policy, building political networks in Iowa and New Hampshire, wooing elected officials whose endorsements might make a difference, and\u2014most of all\u2014courting donors.\n\nMost of the invisible primary is, well, invisible. Getting inside the rooms in New York and Miami and Dallas and Washington where the transactions of the invisible primary take place is nearly impossible. Sometimes good stories drip out, but they make for terrible TV. Meanwhile, much of the public portion of the invisible primary bores the media. Generally, the policy speeches and town-hall events in the early stages of the campaign are vague and uninteresting, as candidates resist taking firm and detailed positions on controversial topics for fear of opening themselves up to attacks later on.\n\nBut the political press demands drama. If it is not given a plot, it will create one. As Mamet argues, this is hardly unique to reporters. Humans are hardwired to turn mundane experiences into dramatic ones. \u201cIt is in our nature to dramatize,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe dramatize the weather, the traffic, and other impersonal phenomena by employing exaggeration, ironic juxtaposition, inversion, projection, all the tools the dramatist uses to create, and the psychoanalyst uses to interpret, emotionally significant phenomena.\u201d\n\nA political campaign that is organized around a drama has an immediate advantage over one that is not. Mamet argues, and he\u2019s right, that politics \u201csticks closer to traditional drama than does The Stage itself. A problem is stated, the play begins, the hero (candidate) offers herself as the protagonist who will find the solution, and the audience gives its attention.\u201d\n\nWhich of the candidates has done that this year? Trump\u2014and, to some extent, Bernie Sanders\u2014has provided a plot and fared well. Trump has identified a clear problem to which many Republican voters respond: America doesn\u2019t \u201cwin anymore.\u201d And he has offered a simple solution that only he can provide: Trump \u201cwill make America great again.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the problem and solution are laughably vague is a virtue. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has been forgettable exactly because she has insisted on promoting a myriad of highly specific solutions to very concrete problems before she has laid out the one big problem she wants to solve. (In fact, it\u2019s not so different from how Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign of \u201chope and change\u201d crushed Clinton\u2019s campaign of policy white papers.) Mamet argues that a politician \u201cwho promises drama and then delivers only social concern\u201d rarely excites the public. That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u201cessential to the healthy political campaign that the issues be largely or perhaps totally symbolic\u2014i.e. non-quantifiable.\u201d He recites a long list of slogans from recent American history, to which Trump\u2019s could easily be added: \u201cPeace with Honor, Communists in the State Department, Supply Side Economics, Recapture the Dream, Bring Back the Pride.\u201d The less detail, he argues, the more engaged the audience will be: \u201cA loose abstraction allows audience members to project their own desires onto an essentially featureless goal.\u201d\n\nTrump realized all of this, and he has had a great first act. But Wednesday night\u2019s debate suggested that he has no plan for a second act. First acts are famously easy to pull off. \u201cIt has often been remarked that anyone can write a good first act,\u201d Mamet notes. \u201cWhen the curtain goes up, we\u2019ve got your attention. So we dramatists don\u2019t have to do anything for a while. Later, either the plot will kick in or the audience will start yawning and eating popcorn.\u201d\n\nThe struggle of the second act in a political campaign, as in any drama, is that the problem identified at the beginning\u2014the one that seized our attention\u2014must be translated into the more mundane tasks that propel the protagonist toward his or her goal. Won\u2019t even the most committed Trump supporter start to wonder why this self-proclaimed savior hasn\u2019t prepared himself to answer standard policy questions?

Last night Rachel Maddow revealed that the \u201cgroup\u201d is actually just one guy in South Dakota and that it has $30 in the bank. Raw Story recaps:\n\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow exposed the \u201cveterans group\u201d using an appearance by Donald Trump as a fundraiser on Tuesday as an apparent one-man organization. Trump\u2019s appearance aboard the USS Iowa, she explained, was an event benefiting Veterans for a Strong America, with tickets ranging between $100 and $1,000. However, Maddow said, the Federal Election Commission filings for the group\u2019s PAC reveal that, besides having only $30 cash in hand and $318 in debts, the organization\u2019s only member is founder Joel Arends. \u201cDonald Trump was not in the military, but he did use a pretty military backdrop tonight to raise money for a non-existent veterans\u2019 group, which endorsed him formally as part of his introduction \u2014 and he said they have hundreds of thousands of members,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t. And so the whole thing is fake.\u201d\n\nTrump has yet to acknowledge the scandal.\n\n"], ["http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-may-not-have-a-second-act", "Donald Trump May Not Have a Second Act", "In 1998, David Mamet, the acclaimed playwright, published a short treatise, \u201cThree Uses of the Knife,\u201d on \u201cthe nature and purpose of drama.\u201d The book, based on lectures he delivered the previous year at Columbia University, is well regarded in the theatre world and among screenwriters for its philosophical approach to explaining what makes good drama. But Mamet\u2019s book also offers some shrewd observations on politics and serves as a useful tool for understanding the rise, and potential fall, of Donald Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, during the Republican Presidential debate on CNN, Trump was exposed as ignorant of basic policy details (he was a bystander during the foreign-policy exchanges), boorish (he refused to apologize to Columba Bush for saying that her background influenced Jeb\u2019s allegedly permissive views on undocumented immigrants), and he seemed\u2014no other way to put it\u2014\u201clow energy\u201d as the debate dragged on into its third hour. (As my colleague Amy Davidson put it, \u201che seemed to be insulting people just to stay awake.\u201d) Political observers then spent the day after the debate ruminating on whether we may be witnessing the beginning of Trump\u2019s decline, and whether his fate will look similar to that of the five Republican candidates\u2014Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum\u2014who all experienced similar polling surges in the 2012 G.O.P. Presidential contest, before Republican voters wised up and picked Mitt Romney.\n\nWhy did Trump\u2019s support shoot up to an average of almost thirty-five per cent in national polls? The (boring) political-science answer is that Trump\u2019s support was a function of his news coverage. His rise correlates perfectly with the amount of attention he received from the media. When voters, most of whom don\u2019t pay close attention to politics, are asked to choose from a long list of names, a third mention the one that they\u2019ve heard in the news most recently or most frequently.\n\nBut that explanation seems to leave a lot out. Why does the media cover Trump so much? Are voters, especially \u201cthe likely voters\u201d who are often polled, really that passive and ignorant? Why did they express increasingly positive views of him, as measured by favorability ratings, as the summer of Trump rolled on? How did Trump seize our attention?\n\nHe did it by stepping onto the summer stage in a way that none of his rivals did. The other Republican candidates spent 2015 attending to the traditional business of the so-called invisible primary: hiring staff, studying up on policy, building political networks in Iowa and New Hampshire, wooing elected officials whose endorsements might make a difference, and\u2014most of all\u2014courting donors.\n\nMost of the invisible primary is, well, invisible. Getting inside the rooms in New York and Miami and Dallas and Washington where the transactions of the invisible primary take place is nearly impossible. Sometimes good stories drip out, but they make for terrible TV. Meanwhile, much of the public portion of the invisible primary bores the media. Generally, the policy speeches and town-hall events in the early stages of the campaign are vague and uninteresting, as candidates resist taking firm and detailed positions on controversial topics for fear of opening themselves up to attacks later on.\n\nBut the political press demands drama. If it is not given a plot, it will create one. As Mamet argues, this is hardly unique to reporters. Humans are hardwired to turn mundane experiences into dramatic ones. \u201cIt is in our nature to dramatize,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe dramatize the weather, the traffic, and other impersonal phenomena by employing exaggeration, ironic juxtaposition, inversion, projection, all the tools the dramatist uses to create, and the psychoanalyst uses to interpret, emotionally significant phenomena.\u201d\n\nA political campaign that is organized around a drama has an immediate advantage over one that is not. Mamet argues, and he\u2019s right, that politics \u201csticks closer to traditional drama than does The Stage itself. A problem is stated, the play begins, the hero (candidate) offers herself as the protagonist who will find the solution, and the audience gives its attention.\u201d\n\nWhich of the candidates has done that this year? Trump\u2014and, to some extent, Bernie Sanders\u2014has provided a plot and fared well. Trump has identified a clear problem to which many Republican voters respond: America doesn\u2019t \u201cwin anymore.\u201d And he has offered a simple solution that only he can provide: Trump \u201cwill make America great again.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the problem and solution are laughably vague is a virtue. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has been forgettable exactly because she has insisted on promoting a myriad of highly specific solutions to very concrete problems before she has laid out the one big problem she wants to solve. (In fact, it\u2019s not so different from how Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign of \u201chope and change\u201d crushed Clinton\u2019s campaign of policy white papers.) Mamet argues that a politician \u201cwho promises drama and then delivers only social concern\u201d rarely excites the public. That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u201cessential to the healthy political campaign that the issues be largely or perhaps totally symbolic\u2014i.e. non-quantifiable.\u201d He recites a long list of slogans from recent American history, to which Trump\u2019s could easily be added: \u201cPeace with Honor, Communists in the State Department, Supply Side Economics, Recapture the Dream, Bring Back the Pride.\u201d The less detail, he argues, the more engaged the audience will be: \u201cA loose abstraction allows audience members to project their own desires onto an essentially featureless goal.\u201d\n\nTrump realized all of this, and he has had a great first act. But Wednesday night\u2019s debate suggested that he has no plan for a second act. First acts are famously easy to pull off. \u201cIt has often been remarked that anyone can write a good first act,\u201d Mamet notes. \u201cWhen the curtain goes up, we\u2019ve got your attention. So we dramatists don\u2019t have to do anything for a while. Later, either the plot will kick in or the audience will start yawning and eating popcorn.\u201d\n\nThe struggle of the second act in a political campaign, as in any drama, is that the problem identified at the beginning\u2014the one that seized our attention\u2014must be translated into the more mundane tasks that propel the protagonist toward his or her goal. Won\u2019t even the most committed Trump supporter start to wonder why this self-proclaimed savior hasn\u2019t prepared himself to answer standard policy questions? Will Trump build a staff and campaign infrastructure in Iowa and New Hampshire to handle all the dull mechanics of finding voters and getting them to the polls? Again, Obama\u2019s historic 2008 campaign is a good point of comparison: the vague promise of \u201chope and change\u201d was married to an enormously sophisticated national operation that tended to the mechanics of winning the delegates needed to capture his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nMamet illustrates second-act problems\u2014and their solutions\u2014by pointing to the real-life examples of political actors who actually changed history.

Dr. Ben Carson, man of science, endorses Trump\u2019s idiotic pseudoscience.\n\nIt\u2019s already well known that Donald Trump is a complete idiot, although the range of his idiocy has widened lately.

He told this story in characteristic sentence fragments: \u201cJust the other day,\u201d he said, \u201ctwo years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d\n\nTo his right, the man of science, the soft-spoken grown up doctor in the room, Ben Carson, who had just quietly pointed out that science has completely debunked any connection whatsoever between vaccines and autism, agreed with sputtering idiot Donald. \u201cIt is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time,\u201d he began. \u201cAnd a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and I think, are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that's appropriate.\u201d\n\nSo, on the one hand, we should be glad that this guy no longer practices medicine, since that is flat-out wrong. On the other, Carson is running for president, with all his crazy, not in the least bit scientific, ideas banging around in his head. (Planned Parenthood is a plot to kill black babies!

He told this story in characteristic sentence fragments: \u201cJust the other day,\u201d he said, \u201ctwo years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d\n\nTo his right, the man of science, the soft-spoken grown up doctor in the room, Ben Carson, who had just quietly pointed out that science has completely debunked any connection whatsoever between vaccines and autism, agreed with sputtering idiot Donald. \u201cIt is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time,\u201d he began. \u201cAnd a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and I think, are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that's appropriate.\u201d\n\nSo, on the one hand, we should be glad that this guy no longer practices medicine, since that is flat-out wrong. On the other, Carson is running for president, with all his crazy, not in the least bit scientific, ideas banging around in his head. (Planned Parenthood is a plot to kill black babies!

This was quite an admission by the .001 percenter, who happens to also have the distinction of paying the largest fine in banking history while still holding on to his overpaid job.\n\nBut back to the inequality thing. Jamie Dimon does not think that the yawning chasm between salaries for people like him and everyone else in the world needs to be addressed, because even if median income is decreasing, cars and iPhones are better. Yee hah!\n\n\u201cIf you go back 20 years ago, cars were worse, health was worse, you didn\u2019t live as long, the air was worse,\u201d he said at an event in Detroit, adding, \u201cPeople didn\u2019t have iPhones.\u201d\n\nShockingly, he self-servingly doesn\u2019t think that slashing CEO pay for people like him is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt is true that income inequality has kind of gotten worse,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cYou can take the compensation of every CEO in America and make it zero and it wouldn\u2019t put a dent into it.\u201d\n\nWorth a shot, though, don'tcha think?\n\n4.

Apart from scoring a point off Trump\u2014which everyone enjoyed\u2014Fiorina offered a litany of demagoguery about calling Netanyahu, threatening Iran, refusing to speak to Putin, and building up our military. All of this, to show the world that America \u201cis back in the leadership business.\u201d\n\nWhile much of what Fiorina said was wrong, perhaps her biggest outright, undeniably intentional lie was when she said: \u201cAs regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes, watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\u201d\n\nJust one teensy eensy little problem. There is no such scene in the now infamous, and infamously misleading, undercover video about Planned Parenthood. Fiorina made up that little overhyped and deliberately horrific lie, it appears, out of whole cloth.

In 1977, SCOTUS held, in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, that police can order people out of their vehicle during a traffic stop, conduct a pat down, and this did not violate their Fourth Amendment right.\n\nHowever, this was not a traffic stop. Sadly was in a parking lot of an apartment complex waiting for his friend and eating a hamburger.\n\nRegardless of the officer demanding Sadly to exit the vehicle, he still searched him without consent, and this is still considered illegal.\n\nWas Sadly hurting someone? Was there a victim involved? Was someone\u2019s property or well-being endangered by his choice to eat a hamburger in his car and wait for a friend?\n\nThe answer to all those questions is, no.

Forbes has apparently given in and decided to post the truth.\n\nObamacare is helping create high-paying healthcare jobs, therefore it helps the economy as a whole.\n\nFrom the article:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which is infusing millions of new paying customers into the economy who previously couldn\u2019t afford medical care services, continues to boost jobs growth as the health industry emphasizes outpatient care and value-based medicine. The health care industry added 22,000 jobs last month, which was about on par with February totals for health services jobs, according to the jobs report issued Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the past year alone, 363,000 jobs have been added in the health sector. The entire U.S. economy added 126,000 jobs in March though such totals ended a string of 12 consecutive months when 200,000 jobs or more were added to employment rolls.\n\nPeople in hell were given some ice water as Forbes didn\u2019t have anything negative to say about the ACA, didn\u2019t have any spin available as to why this was a bad thing, and didn\u2019t forecast any doom and gloom as a result of the jobs report.\n\nThey just\u2026reported the news\u2026as it is, in black and white, with optimism for an industry many said would crumble when the President\u2019s pen hit the bill and made it law.\n\nThere\u2019s little hope that outlets like Fox News, The Blaze, Mr. Conservative and Town Hall will follow suit, but at least with this to throw in their faces they might in the very least ignore the continuous jobs growth in our country rather than attempting to turn it into a push towards socialism or offer some ridiculous reason why the economy will crash as people get healthier.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d put this in print:\n\nThank you, Forbes.

Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

There was some monkey business involved in it as well.\n\nA new book by Gwenda Blair, The Trumps: Three Generations That Built An Empire, describes how Trump\u2019s grandfather came to the U.S. from his native Germany, started a small business in America, then set out for Canada to try to find a fortune during the Klondike gold rush.\n\nFriedrich Trump, a barber\u2019s apprentice in Germany, set out for America in 1885 at age 16. Friedrich\u2019s father had died young, and the young man was looking to do something other than become a barber. He wound up in Manhattan at a time when, as Blair observes, there were no immigration quotas, and became a naturalized American. He Anglicized his name to Frederick and wound up in Seattle, looking to make his fortune.\n\nIn Seattle, the young Trump leased a small restaurant known as the Poodle Dog, which also advertised \u201cprivate rooms for ladies,\u201d which at that time was a reference to prostitution. His restaurant was doing well, but when he heard that John D. Rockefeller was financing a mining operation in a town called Monte Cristo, Trump knew he had to get in on it. In Monte Cristo, Trump filed a mineral claim that he had no intention of working, built a hotel on the land even though he didn\u2019t own it, and returned to the business of offering customers food, booze, and women. When the Monte Cristo mining boom began to peter out both Rockefeller and Trump quietly backed out. This made them, according to Blair, two of the few who made money on the adventure.\n\nBy this time, miners had begun arriving to make the journey to the Yukon to mine for gold. Trump saw a golden opportunity. Not in mining, but in a series of trail-side restaurants that would also supply the miners with prostitutes. Just like his grandson\u2019s casinos, Frederick Trump intended to make his fortune by, as Blair puts it, \u201cmining the miners.\u201d\n\nIn 1900, Trump was living in White Horse, Yukon, where he had once again built a hotel on land he didn\u2019t own, across from the railroad station. His Arctic Restaurant offered arriving miners the things he had offered in his other ventures: food, liquor, gambling, and prostitutes. This business was to be short-lived, however. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police \u2014 the \u201cMounties\u201d \u2014 were beginning to crack down on vice in the territory. But Trump had made his money, and as the Yukon gold rush was coming to an end, he made his way back to his native Germany, with a nest egg equal to about $600,000 in today\u2019s money. What happened next was the height of irony, given his grandson\u2019s talk about deporting undocumented immigrants in the U.S.\n\nWhile in Germany, Trump got married. But he also ran into a problem. Military service was mandatory, but since he left at 16, he had been too young to serve. Now, he was over 35, and too old to serve. Trump tried to buy his way out of the predicament by offering to deposit his money in the village treasury. He then swore that he had not intended to avoid service, but was merely trying to help his mother. All he wanted to do was regain his German citizenship, and \u201clead a quiet life.\u201d Local officials liked the plan. But Frederick Trump was not anybody important, and regional authorities rejected it. Frederick Trump, his wife who was at the time pregnant with Donald\u2019s father Fred, and their daughter were stripped of their German citizenship and put on a boat to the United States.\n\nFrederick Trump is, according to the headline on Gwenda Blair\u2019s story at Politico, is the person who made \u201cThe Donald\u201d who he is. A shrewd businessman who was not afraid to bend the rules to his advantage. Most importantly, he was an immigrant who actually started his fortune not in the \u201cland of opportunity,\u201d America, but in Canada, and who was deported from his own homeland.\n\nIf only Germany had kept Frederick, America right now might not be dealing with \u201cThe Donald.\u201d\n\nFeatured image via UpHere/Gage Skidmore composite"], ["http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hate-speech-laws-First-Amendment-Dershowitz/2014/05/08/id/570277/", "Hate Speech Laws a 'Dangerous Trend'", "Editor's Note:\n\nGovt Prohibited From Helping Seniors (Shocking)\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\""], ["http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/walker-bummed-he-was-unable-to-show-he-memorized-three-branches-of-government", "Scott Walker Missed Chance to Show Memorization Skills", "DES MOINES (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Assessing his performance in the aftermath of the second Republican Presidential debate, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said he was \u201csaddened\u201d that he never got a chance to show that he had memorized the three branches of the federal government.\n\n\u201cIf you do all of that homework and nobody even knows that you did it, what\u2019s the whole point of doing it in the first place?\u201d Walker, who was campaigning in Iowa, said. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said it didn\u2019t suck.\u201d\n\nWalker said he had memorized the three branches in the hopes of dazzling the audience with his knowledge of the inner workings of the federal government, but \u201cthere just didn\u2019t seem to be a good time to get it all in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Jake Tapper had asked something about the size of the federal government, for example,\u201d Walker said, \u201cthen I would have been like, \u2018It\u2019s three branches big, Jake.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

They are up four-fold, from 6,300 to 27,000. Another 17,700 claims were made by Albanians, whose country is not at war but does share a European border.\n\nA further 13,900 applicants came from Iraq which, like neighbouring Syria, is being smashed by the Islamic State terrorists.\n\nHalf a million migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, with 156,000 coming in August alone.

This figure is up from two in three in 2007 (67%) and 2009 (66%).\n\nWhile the numbers have fluctuated slightly since 2007, the trend has been largely stable since 2010. However, the percentage of U.S. adults who see corruption as pervasive has never been less than a majority in the past decade, which has had no shortage of controversies from the U.S. Justice Department's firings of U.S. attorneys to the IRS scandal.\n\nThese figures are higher than some might expect, and while the lack of improvement is somewhat disconcerting, the positive takeaway is that Americans still feel fairly free to criticize their government. This is not the case in some parts of the world. Questions about corruption are so sensitive in some countries that even if Gallup is allowed to ask them, the results may reflect residents' reluctance to disparage their government. This is particularly true in countries where media freedom is restricted.\n\nThis is why it is most appropriate to look at perceptions of corruption through such lenses as the Freedom House's Press Freedom rankings. Ratings vary among countries with a \"free press,\" including the U.S., and range from a high of 90% in Lithuania to a low of 14% in Sweden.

But these models dramatically fail basic verification tests. Nowhere do they admit to these well-known failures. Instead, we are led to believe that their climate models are close to perfection,\" assert the scientists.The 829-page NCA report was released on May 6 and was characterized by administration officials as \"the most comprehensive, authoritative, transparent scientific report on U.S. climate change impacts ever generated.\"The administration seized on the NCA findings as justification for its push to further regulate the fossil-fuel industry and to bolster alternative green-energy sources.The scientists' rebuttal, however, strongly challenges the theory of Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW), which it says is \"based on a string of inferences that begins with the assumptions\" that human burning of fossil fuels is driving up atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and \"is so grossly flawed it should play no role in U.S. Energy Policy Analyses and CO2 regulatory processes.\"The scientists do not have any affiliation with any particular organization and have worked together pro bono for several years.Among the signatories are: Dr. George Wolff, who formerly chaired the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee; Joseph S. D'Aleo, a fellow with the American Meteorological Society; Dr. Neil Laverne Frank, former director of the National Hurricane Center in Florida; and William M. \"Bill\" Gray, emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University.The authors criticize the NCA report for a lack of objectivity and its failure to include input from scientists who may question whether climate change is irrefutable and that a robust regulatory response is required.\"Science derives its objectivity from robust logic and honest evidence repeatedly tested by all knowledgeable scientists, not just those paid to support the administration's version of \"Global Warming,' 'Climate Change,' 'Climate Disruption,' or whatever their marketing specialists call it today,\" they said.The NCA and the White House assert that urgent action is needed because increasing average temperatures in the United States are responsible for a greater frequency of extreme weather events.According to the NCA, average temperatures have increased between 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit and 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895 and forecasting models show a potential increase of an additional 4 degrees Fahrenheit if countermeasures are not adopted, including cap-and-trade, greater subsidization of green energy, and reduced fossil fuel production.According to the NCA, \"human influences are the primary driver of recent climate change is based on multiple lines of independent evidence.\"The scientists describe that contention as \"grossly flawed\" and take issue with the EPA's claim \u2014 used to justify greenhouse gas regulation \u2014 that there is \"90-99 percent certainty that observed warming in the latter half of the twentieth century resulted from human activity.\"That claim \"is totally at odds with multiple robust, consistent, independently-derived empirical datasets, all showing no statistically significant positive (or negative) trend in temperature,\" they wrote. \"Therefore, EPA's theory \u2026 must be rejected.\"The group of scientists made similar points in a Supreme Court amicus involving EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.In the brief the scientists assert EPA's entire hypothesis that CO2 emissions endanger human health and safety has been falsified by real-world evidence.\"As the most important example, EPA asserts as its central 'line of evidence' for CO2 'endangerment' that CO2 will warm the surface temperature of the earth through a mechanism by which rising CO2 concentrations in the troposphere in the tropics block heat transfer into outer space.\"They said that if EPA's hypothesis were accurate there would necessarily be an observable \"hot spot\" in the tropical upper troposphere. But that has not been proven to exist, therefore, they write \"the basis that EPA has for this rulemaking is no basis,\" they wrote According to their rebuttal report, \"over the last 130 years the decade of the 1930s still has the most U.S. state high temperatures records.\"Their assertion that climate disruptions are not increasing, ironically, is echoed in the most recent report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which the White House often cites to support its own argument.Globally, according to the IPCC in its 2012 special report on extreme events, \"since the 1950s some regions of the world have experienced a trend to more intense and longer droughts, in particular in southern Europe and West Africa, but in some regions droughts have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for example, in central North America and northwestern Australia.\"Furthermore, the IPCC in 2013 concluded that \"current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century\" and \"no robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.\"The scientists also dispute the administration's claims that proposed regulation of carbon dioxide can be achieved in a cost-effective manner that will create jobs and produce economic benefit. Rather, they argue, those policies will restrict economic growth causing harm to the poor.\"Unilateral CO2 emission control by the United States promises to damage the economy of the United States without any benefits. In fact, increasing CO2 in the atmosphere facilitates achieving the goal of raising the poor out of poverty through increasing food production,\" the scientists wrote in their amicus brief."], ["http://www.alternet.org/tea-party-and-right/5-jaw-dropping-right-wing-idiocies-week-palins-insane-reaction-ahmed-mohamed?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "5 Jaw-Dropping Right-Wing Idiocies This Week: Palin's Insane Reaction to Ahmed Mohamed", "5 Jaw-Dropping Right-Wing Idiocies This Week: Palin's Insane Reaction to Ahmed Mohamed\n\n1. Sarah Palin rants about how Ahmed Mohamed was up to no good when he brought that clock to school.\n\nMama Bear Palin actually managed to make her dim-witted daughter Bristol look almost reasonable this week. While Bristol went on record on her blog saying that 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed should probably not have been arrested for bringing a clock to school, Sarah ranted thusly on Facebook:\n\n\u201cYep, believing that\u2019s a clock in a school pencil box is like believing Barack Obama is ruling over the most transparent administration in history. Right. That\u2019s a clock, and I\u2019m the queen of England.\u201d\n\nHer deranged comments hardly ended there:\n\n\u201cFriends, consider the kids disciplined and/or kicked out of school for bringing squirt guns to school or taking bites out of a pop tart until it resembled (to some politically correct yahoo) a gun. Or the student out deer hunting with his dad early one morning who forgot he had a box of ammo in his truck when he parked in the school\u2019s lot later that day. Kids humiliated and intimidated for innocent actions like those real examples are often marked the rest of their lives and made to feel really rotten. Whereas Ahmed Muhammad, [sic] an evidently obstinate-answering student bringing in a homemade 'clock' that obviously could be seen by conscientious teachers as a dangerous wired-up bomb-looking contraption (teachers who are told 'if you see something, say something!') gets invited to the White House.\u201d\n\nOn this Mama and Baby Grizzly agreed. President Obama had no business inviting wrongly arrested Ahmed to the White House. Who does he think he is, the president of the United States? Maybe the queen of England? That would be just like him, you know.\n\n\u201cBy the way, President Obama\u2019s practice of jumping in cases prematurely to interject himself as the cool savior, wanting so badly to attach himself to the issue-of-the-day, got old years ago,\u201d Palin wrote.\n\nYeah, Bristol blogged, this is \u201cthe kind of stuff Obama needs to STAY out of.\u201d\n\nWhy does she think that? \u201cThis encourages more racial strife that is already going on with the \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 crowd and encourages victimhood,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar right-wing trope, racial strife is somehow created by those who point out racism, instead of those perpetuating racism.\n\nOf course, that is a concept that goes whizzing by both Palin women's heads.\n\n2. Dr. Ben Carson, man of science, endorses Trump\u2019s idiotic pseudoscience.\n\nIt\u2019s already well known that Donald Trump is a complete idiot, although the range of his idiocy has widened lately. At the debate Wednesday night, the Donald busted out his anecdotal pseudoscience about vaccines, credulously repeating stories about perfectly healthy babies who turned autistic after being vaccinated. He told this story in characteristic sentence fragments: \u201cJust the other day,\u201d he said, \u201ctwo years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d\n\nTo his right, the man of science, the soft-spoken grown up doctor in the room, Ben Carson, who had just quietly pointed out that science has completely debunked any connection whatsoever between vaccines and autism, agreed with sputtering idiot Donald. \u201cIt is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time,\u201d he began. \u201cAnd a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and I think, are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that's appropriate.\u201d\n\nSo, on the one hand, we should be glad that this guy no longer practices medicine, since that is flat-out wrong. On the other, Carson is running for president, with all his crazy, not in the least bit scientific, ideas banging around in his head. (Planned Parenthood is a plot to kill black babies! Homosexuality is a choice because raped prisoners come out gay!) And he is gaining in the polls! Head for the hills!\n\n3. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, admits income inequality is real. But it\u2019s okay, because iPhones.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, one of the highest paid CEOs in the world, who was paid $20 million last year, acknowledged this week that income inequality is a thing, and that it has gotten worse in the past 20 years. This was quite an admission by the .001 percenter, who happens to also have the distinction of paying the largest fine in banking history while still holding on to his overpaid job.\n\nBut back to the inequality thing. Jamie Dimon does not think that the yawning chasm between salaries for people like him and everyone else in the world needs to be addressed, because even if median income is decreasing, cars and iPhones are better. Yee hah!\n\n\u201cIf you go back 20 years ago, cars were worse, health was worse, you didn\u2019t live as long, the air was worse,\u201d he said at an event in Detroit, adding, \u201cPeople didn\u2019t have iPhones.\u201d\n\nShockingly, he self-servingly doesn\u2019t think that slashing CEO pay for people like him is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt is true that income inequality has kind of gotten worse,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cYou can take the compensation of every CEO in America and make it zero and it wouldn\u2019t put a dent into it.\u201d\n\nWorth a shot, though, don'tcha think?\n\n4. Carly Fiorina basically lies about Planned Parenthood; much of media lets her get away with it and she is declared winner of the debate.\n\nIf you were unable to watch Wednesday night\u2019s Republican debate due to boredom, horror, tending your hair, or just a scheduling conflict, you might have missed some of the gems that flowed forth from declared winner Carly Fiorina. Apart from scoring a point off Trump\u2014which everyone enjoyed\u2014Fiorina offered a litany of demagoguery about calling Netanyahu, threatening Iran, refusing to speak to Putin, and building up our military. All of this, to show the world that America \u201cis back in the leadership business.\u201d\n\nWhile much of what Fiorina said was wrong, perhaps her biggest outright, undeniably intentional lie was when she said: \u201cAs regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes, watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\u201d\n\nJust one teensy eensy little problem. There is no such scene in the now infamous, and infamously misleading, undercover video about Planned Parenthood. Fiorina made up that little overhyped and deliberately horrific lie, it appears, out of whole cloth. Or, to give her the benefit of the doubt, perhaps she dreamt it.\n\nNo matter, the audience and the conservative twitterverse loved it. Being factually challenged, even about her own fictionally successful past at Hewlett-Packard, will not stop this woman.\n\n5. John Kasich, the \u201cmoderate\u201d in the Republican primary, suggests a good way to show appreciation for Hispanics is by leaving \"a little tip.\u201d\n\nDuring the Wednesday debate, Kasich stayed out of the stupid argument about whether it is okay for Jeb Bush or anyone else to speak Spanish. He also steered clear of the discussion about immigration policies that could affect the workers at the Reagan Library. But this does not mean he doesn\u2019t know anything about Hispanic people. In fact, his maid at the hotel was a Latina, which apparently lends him some expertise on issues concerning people from the Spanish-speaking parts of the world.\n\nWhy, the day after the debate, Kasich was discussing Latinos, and more importantly, the Latino vote, and he trotted out his maid as an example. \"A lot of them do jobs that they're willing to do, and uh, that's why in the hotel you leave a little tip,\" Kasich reportedly told L.A. Times political correspondent Kurtis Lee.\n\nKasich appeared totally unaware that he was conflating Latinos with service-industry workers, and kind of insulting both groups in his aw-shucks, I\u2019m the reasonable old white guy in the race with a semblance of a heart routine.\n\nUmmm, not really."], ["http://act.credoaction.com/sign/wildfire_funding?sp_ref=150173798.4.15932.t.66050.2&referring_akid=.1980537.TAJkaS&source=tw_sp", "Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act... and make polluters pay for it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse.

Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

They have severely weakened the independence of the primary branch of our government \u2013 the Congress\u2014and fought off any court challenges with medieval defenses, such as no American citizen has any standing to sue for harm done by such treaties or the subject is a political, not judicial, matter.\n\nOnly corporations, astonishingly enough, are entitled to sue the U.S. government for any alleged harm to their profits from health, safety or other regulations in secret tribunals that operate as offshore kangaroo courts, not in open courts.\n\nWe Interrupt This Article with an Urgent Message!

President Obama and some members of Congress say that the TPP will be different from NAFTA and the WTO, but I doubt that they have read the entire draft of the TPP. They\u2019re relying on summary memos by the U.S. Trade Office and corporate lawyers, for example, drug companies that sugarcoat the complex monopolistic extension of the pharmaceutical patents and how this will result in higher prices for your medicines.\n\nI challenge President Obama to state publically that he has read the entire TPP. Even a benign monarch would do this for his/her trusting subjects.\n\nInside these hundreds of pages of cross references and repeals of conflicting existing laws is the central subversion, subordinating our protective laws for labor, consumers and the environment (impersonally called \u201cnon-tariff trader barriers\u201d) to the supremacy of international global commercial traffic.\n\nOne very recent example \u2013 by no means the worst possible \u2013 just occurred. After Congress passed a popular \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labeling requirement on meat packages sold in supermarkets, Brazil and Mexico, both exporters of meat to the U.S.A, challenged this U.S. law in a secret (yes, literally secret in all respects) tribunal in Geneva under the World Trade Organization Treaty. Brazil and Mexico won this legal challenge.\n\n\u201cMany Americans will be shocked that the WTO can order our government to deny U.S. consumers the basic information about where their food comes from and that if the information policy is not gutted, we could face millions in sanctions every year,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling spotlights how these so called \u2018trade\u2019 deals are packed with non-trade provisions that threaten our most basic rights, such as even knowing the source and safety of what\u2019s on our dinner plate.\u201d A May 2013 survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that 90% of adult Americans favored this \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d requirement.\n\nFearing billions of dollars in penalties, the U.S. Congress is racing to repeal its own law. See how the noose works: foreign countries trying to pull down our higher standards can take conflicts to secret tribunals with three trade judges, who also have corporate clients and can say to the U.S., \u201cGet rid of your protections or pay billions of dollars in tribute.\u201d\n\nThe same noose can choke efforts by the U.S. to upgrade our health, safety, and economic rights. Had air bags been proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation under today\u2019s global trade uber alles regimes, the proposal would have had to go to a harmonization committee of the WTO\u2019s signatory countries that would sandpaper or reject this life-saving technology. Or if the U.S. went it alone, it would expose itself to repeal or pay by car-exporting nations.\n\nFor ten reasons why the TPP is a bad idea for our country and the world see my recent Common Dreams column.\n\nIf this all sounds so outrageous as to strain credulity, go beneath the tip of this iceberg and visit: Global Trade Warch and Flush the TPP. Then, get ready for the battle over the TPP itself in the late autumn. The following are three examples of how to build resistance to an international problem in your local communities.\n\nFirst, send the legislators who supported the fast track handcuffs a CITIZENS\u2019 SUMMONS to appear at a town meeting where you, not they, present the agenda. If the lawmakers think 500 or more determined people will show up, it is very likely they will relent and meet with you. The unions and other groups working to stop the TPP around the country can get their people to attend these town meetings. August is the congressional recess month. The senators and representative will have no excuse to avoid a town meeting with their constituents. For a list of those legislators who need to be focused on, visit \"Stop Fast Track\".\n\nSecond, hustle together some modest money from groups and individuals, rent an empty storefront, plaster the windows with large signs, and start a rumble of civic resistance in all directions. Politicians sometimes shrug off the warnings of losing contributions from unions. What politicians do fear is their inability to control groups of resurgent voters indeterminately expanding from inside their district or state.\n\nSince opposition to TPP reflects a Left-Right alliance in Congress and back home, store fronts spell real worry for politicians. They should worry because they chose not to do their homework for their home country.\n\nThird, hold rallies designed to attract, collectively, hundreds or thousands of people around the country. These rallies could have an array of high-profile speakers and entertainers, as well as workers who have been harmed by past so-called trade agreements. Rallies can bring in new people and start the process of galvanizing them about the many problems with the TPP.\n\nRemember, 75 percent of Americans think that the TPP should be rejected or delayed according to a bipartisan poll from the Wall Street Journal.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

It stinks of leftist exploitation.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know. On Monday, Mohammed brought a homemade clock to school. For those who don\u2019t know the ins-and-outs of electronics, the device looked like a possible incendiary device. Ahmed told the media that he made the clock last weekend and brought it to school to show his engineering teacher. He explained to local news, \u201cIt was the first time I brought an invention to school to show a teacher.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t explain that to police, however, according to the authorities. And he didn\u2019t just show the device to his engineering teacher. In fact, the engineering teacher told him not to carry the device around after Mohammed showed him, according to The New York Times:\n\nHe said he took it to school on Monday to show an engineering teacher, who said it was nice but then told him he should not show the invention to other teachers. Later, Ahmed\u2019s clock beeped during an English class, and after he revealed the device to the teacher, school officials notified the police, and Ahmed was interrogated by officers. \u201cShe thought it was a threat to her,\u201d Ahmed told reporters Wednesday. \u201cSo it was really sad that she took a wrong impression of it.\u201d\n\nWhy was the device in English class in the first place, especially after the engineering teacher told him not to show it around? When confronted by police and his English teacher, why didn\u2019t Mohammed just tell them to talk to the engineering teacher? When police asked Ahmed what the device was and why he brought it to school, according to WFAA:\n\nOfficers said Ahmed was being \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d in his answers to their questions, and didn\u2019t have a \u201creasonable answer\u201d as to what he was doing with the case. Investigators said the student told them that it was just a clock that he was messing around with. \u201cWe attempted to question the juvenile about what it was and he would simply only say it was a clock. He didn\u2019t offer any explanation as to what it was for, why he created this device, why he brought it to school,\u201d said James McLellan, Irving Police.\n\nHere\u2019s the statute Ahmed Mohammed authorities originally suspected Mohammed of violating (Texas Penal Code Section 46.08):\n\n(a) A person commits an offense if the person knowingly manufactures, sells, purchases, transports, or possesses a hoax bomb with intent to use the hoax bomb to: (1) make another believe that the hoax bomb is an explosive or incendiary device; or (2) cause alarm or reaction of any type by an official of a public safety agency or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies. (b) An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nNobody said Mohammed built an actual bomb. They suspected that he had wanted to frighten or alarm officials with a hoax-bomb. When they found out he didn\u2019t intend to do that, they released him.\n\nGiven the limited evidence available, this is not far-fetched. Again, where was the engineering teacher to vouch for Mohammed\u2019s story? Why didn\u2019t Mohammed simply explain himself? The police said that initially, it was \u201cnot immediately evident\u201d that the clock-in-a-case was a class experiment \u2013 perfectly plausible, given that Mohammed built the clock-in-a-case voluntarily, without assignment, and in conjunction with no science fair.\n\nChief Larry Boyd said simply and correctly, \u201cYou can\u2019t take things like that to school\u201d without explanation or assignment in today\u2019s world without it receiving scrutiny.\n\nAnd according to the cops, Ahmed was significantly more cooperative with friendly media than with the police who came to ask some simple questions.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not a coincidence. Ahmed\u2019s father, as Pamela Geller points out, is an anti-Islamophobia media gadfly. He routinely returns to Sudan to run for president; he has debated anti-Koran Florida pastor Terry Jones, partially in order to bring his children to Disneyworld. In 2011, the Washington Post wrote of him:\n\nElhassan, a native of the Sudan who is now an American citizen, likes to call himself a sheik. He wears a cleric\u2019s flowing white robes and claims hundreds of followers throughout Egypt, Sudan and in the United States. But he is unknown as a scholar or holy man in the state he has called home for two decades. Religious leaders in Texas say they have never heard of Elhassan, including the imam at the mosque where he worships.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Ahmed Mohammed\u2019s dad ran to the cameras at the first opportunity. It\u2019s also no surprise that the terror-connected Council on American-Islamic Relations arrived to push the Islamophobia narrative immediately.\n\nBut there\u2019s a long history of detaining science students for experiments administrators don\u2019t understand. Homer Hickam, the subject of the movie October Sky, found himself in handcuffs during the Cold War for starting a forest fire with a rocket he built. And since September 11, such incidents have become more common. As someone who went to a Jewish high school based in Los Angeles and located next to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, police and security regularly evacuated our high school due to bomb threats. If one of the students had brought a device to school in this fashion, the student would have been detained and questioned \u2013 again, in an all-Jewish school.\n\nAnd as Ian Tuttle of National Review has pointed out, America has become extra-paranoid of late: students have been suspended for gun-shaped Pop Tarts, cap guns, finger guns, and saying the word gun, among other grave offenses. And we don\u2019t even need weapons to suspend students anymore: wearing an American flag at the wrong time or donning a Confederate flag t-shirt will do it.\n\nSo why, after the detention and release, did this story become a national one? Why did Obama jump on this story? Why did Hillary jump on this story? Where were they for then-16-year-old Kiera Wilmot of Florida to the White House after she was arrested and suspended in 2013 for bringing an experiment with toilet cleaner and aluminum foil to school? She was black but not Muslim, so it didn\u2019t serve the narrative. They were MIA.\n\nFor years, the Obama administration has pushed the notion that American Muslims are in danger of Islamophobic backlash. But as of 2012, 62.4 percent of all anti-religious hate crimes targeted Jews; 11.6 percent targeted Muslims; as of 2013, anti-Jewish hate crimes represented 60.3 percent of all hate crimes, as opposed to just 13.7 percent for Muslims. That\u2019s a major decline in anti-Islamic hate crimes since 2001, when 55.7 percent of hate crimes were anti-Jewish, and anti-Muslim hate crimes constituted 27.2 percent of all hate crimes.\n\nSo where, exactly, are all the invitations to Jewish students targeted in hate crime incidents?\n\nThey don\u2019t exist, because they don\u2019t help President Obama castigate America as xenophobic and backwards \u2013 and just as importantly, castigate Texans as particularly likely to don white hoods and go hunt down some Sufis.\n\nThe narrative reigns supreme. Ahmed Mohammed brought a clock-in-a-case that looked like a hoax bomb to the uninformed to school; his engineering teacher told him not to show it around; he showed it around; the police showed up, and he was allegedly uncooperative; they decided he was innocent and released him.\n\nThat\u2019s not a national scandal. That\u2019s local cops and teachers and administrators doing their jobs, decently but cautiously. Yet that won\u2019t be what you hear. You\u2019ll just hear that America hates Muslims, even as Americans self-righteously tweet out #IStandWithAhmed without hearing the facts.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).

If you want to know how and why, consider three of the ongoing scandals that continued to fester over the weekend.\n\nThe first concerns allegations of vote-rigging in London borough of Tower Hamlets, where scandal-wracked, Islamist-linked mayor Lutfur Rahman has just won a second term as mayor.\n\nThe mayor himself, according to a senior Labour figure present, was \u201cvisibly throwing his weight around\u201d and being \u201coverly familiar with count staff, some of whom were telling him they had voted for him even as they counted the votes\u201d. Mr Golds, another subjected to a recount, found his vote had changed by more than a fifth overnight, from 1,098 to 1,345. And Sanu Miah? In the recount, his vote dropped by a quarter from 2,270 to 1,722 and he fell from first place to sixth. Two of the three seats in his ward went to Mr Rahman\u2019s Tower Hamlets First party. \u201cI think this election was stolen from me,\u201d said Mr Miah. Not everyone agrees with that. One of Mr Miah\u2019s opponents had the same surname: the counters could have got them mixed up. But he might be right. The normal rules do not apply in Tower Hamlets. It was Britain\u2019s most troubling election in Britain\u2019s most troubling borough.\n\nThen there\u2019s the similarly troubling case of Operation Trojan Horse \u2013 the campaign to infiltrate a number of state schools in Birmingham, oust non-Muslim teachers, hijack the curriculum, segregate boys from girls and create a corner of the English Midlands that is forever Islamabad.\n\nAt Park View, for example, there have been complaints of segregation in classrooms and of GCSE syllabuses being restricted to comply with conservative Islamic teaching.Sex education lessons have allegedly seen impressionable teenage boys told that rape is legal in marriage, while religious education classes have apparently seen pupils given a list of Christian teachers and told to try to convert them.At one assembly, a senior teacher is said to have endorsed terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki. At another, detailed by a Sunday newspaper, he allegedly described non-Muslims to pupils as \u2018kuffar\u2019 \u2014 or infidels. Sex education lessons have, according to reports in a Sunday newspaper, seen impressionable teenage boys told rape is legal in marriage, while religious education classes have seen pupils given a list of Christian teachers and told to try to convert themLast November, Sheikh Shady al-Suleiman, a preacher many regard as extremist, was invited to speak at the school. Nigel Sloan, a former teacher at the school, has said Mozz Hussain, the deputy headmaster, preached \u2018mind-blowing\u2019 anti-American and anti-Western \u2018propaganda\u2019 to pupils, describing the U.S. as \u2018the evil in the world\u2019 and \u2018the cause of all famine\u2019.\n\nAnd finally, from Charles Moore, an excellent insight as to why this has been allowed to happen. In a piece entitled \u201cOur voting system is flawed but politicians don\u2019t seem to care\u201d, he writes:\n\nTower Hamlets has been a problem for many years, but its controversies are notunique. There have been cases of electoral malpractice in Birmingham,Bradford, Slough, Woking, Peterborough. There are also serious problems,particularly in big cities, with the Electoral Register.\n\nFraud, he says, is widespread \u2013 and known by the authorities to be widespread:\n\nThere are two reasons for this \u2013 forgery and coercion. The first has now beenmitigated by insisting on postal voters giving a signature and a date ofbirth (in Tower Hamlets this time, no fewer than 10 per cent of the postalvotes returned were rejected because of discrepancies in this area). Thesecond flourishes, particularly in minority ethnic communities, whereleaders can exploit clan or family ties to \u201charvest\u201d votes from theirjuniors and from women.\n\nSo why is so little being done about it? One answer is that the very institutions charged with preventing this kind of behaviour have been turning a deliberate blind eye to it.\n\nEnter the Electoral Commission \u2013 yes, the same Electoral Commission recently embroiled in another scandal concerning a UKIP lookalike on the European election ballot papers. It turns out that this quango, stuffed with usual bien-pensant apparatchiks, is so busy trying to encourage \u201cengagement\u201d \u2013 getting people to take part in the voting process \u2013 that it prefers not to deal with the less fluffy and more challenging issue of voter fraud.\n\nThe Electoral Commission is the body supposed to ensure that all is well with British voting. But if you look at its remit and pronouncements, you will see that it focuses more on engagement than on making votes trustworthy. In a speech in March, its chairman, Jenny Watson, seemed preoccupied with the need to \u201cmodernise\u201d. \u201cAs a society, we are at risk,\u201d she said clumsily, \u201cof how we ask people to engage with our electoral system\u2026 becoming increasingly disconnected from how they interact with both each other and with other institutions, from their banking arrangements to their weekly shop.\u201d The system needed to be \u201cmore reflective of the wider society\u201d. She said how nice it would be if people could register to vote on the actual day of the election. She played down issues of fraud. She praised the work of pressure groups, such as Operation Black Vote (OBV), which try to get new voters. She did not praise anyone who checks that registered voters are true ones.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the Electoral Commission which is to blame. So too are those police \u2013 presumably obeying orders from on high \u2013 stood by and watched as the thoroughly illegal voter intimidation took place in Tower Hamlets. So too are the local councillors in Labour-controlled Birmingham. So too is the coalition government, which is said to have been warned four years ago that Operation Trojan Horse was taking place. So too are the three main political parties, all of whom have agreed that dealing with postal-vote is not priority.\n\nAnd it barely needs spelling out why. Everyone in authority is so afraid of being accused of being \u201cracist\u201d or \u201cIslamophobic\u201d that they have found it easier to sweep the issue under the carpet than confront it. But the problem isn\u2019t going to go away. In fact \u2013 until someone, somewhere finds the courage to deal with it \u2013 it\u2019s bound to get an awful lot worse."], ["http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/06/25/king-obama-his-royal-court-and-tpp", "Breaking News & Views for the Progressive Community", "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) \u2013 a global corporate noose around U.S. local, state, and national sovereignty \u2013 narrowly passed a major procedural hurdle in the Congress by gaining \u201cfast track\u201d status. This term \u201cfast track\u201d is a euphemism for your members of Congress \u2013 senators and representatives \u2013 handcuffing themselves, so as to prevent any amendments or adequate debate before the final vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 another euphemism that is used to avoid the word \u201ctreaty,\u201d which would require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate. This anti-democratic process is being pushed by \u201cKing Obama\u201d and his royal court.\n\nMake no mistake. If this was only a trade treaty \u2013 reducing tariffs, quotas, and the like \u2013 it would not be so controversial. Yet, the corporate-indentured politicians keep calling this gigantic treaty with thirty chapters, of which only five relate to traditional trade issues, a trade agreement instead of a treaty. The other twenty-four chapters, if passed as they are, will have serious impacts on your livelihoods as workers and consumers, as well as your air, water, food, and medicines\n\nThe reason I call President Obama \u201cKing Obama\u201d in this case is that he, and his massive corporate lobbies (royal court), have sought to circumvent the checks and balances system that is the very bedrock of our government. They have severely weakened the independence of the primary branch of our government \u2013 the Congress\u2014and fought off any court challenges with medieval defenses, such as no American citizen has any standing to sue for harm done by such treaties or the subject is a political, not judicial, matter.\n\nOnly corporations, astonishingly enough, are entitled to sue the U.S. government for any alleged harm to their profits from health, safety or other regulations in secret tribunals that operate as offshore kangaroo courts, not in open courts.\n\nWe Interrupt This Article with an Urgent Message!

President Obama and some members of Congress say that the TPP will be different from NAFTA and the WTO, but I doubt that they have read the entire draft of the TPP. They\u2019re relying on summary memos by the U.S. Trade Office and corporate lawyers, for example, drug companies that sugarcoat the complex monopolistic extension of the pharmaceutical patents and how this will result in higher prices for your medicines.\n\nI challenge President Obama to state publically that he has read the entire TPP. Even a benign monarch would do this for his/her trusting subjects.\n\nInside these hundreds of pages of cross references and repeals of conflicting existing laws is the central subversion, subordinating our protective laws for labor, consumers and the environment (impersonally called \u201cnon-tariff trader barriers\u201d) to the supremacy of international global commercial traffic.\n\nOne very recent example \u2013 by no means the worst possible \u2013 just occurred. After Congress passed a popular \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labeling requirement on meat packages sold in supermarkets, Brazil and Mexico, both exporters of meat to the U.S.A, challenged this U.S. law in a secret (yes, literally secret in all respects) tribunal in Geneva under the World Trade Organization Treaty. Brazil and Mexico won this legal challenge.\n\n\u201cMany Americans will be shocked that the WTO can order our government to deny U.S. consumers the basic information about where their food comes from and that if the information policy is not gutted, we could face millions in sanctions every year,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling spotlights how these so called \u2018trade\u2019 deals are packed with non-trade provisions that threaten our most basic rights, such as even knowing the source and safety of what\u2019s on our dinner plate.\u201d A May 2013 survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that 90% of adult Americans favored this \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d requirement.\n\nFearing billions of dollars in penalties, the U.S. Congress is racing to repeal its own law. See how the noose works: foreign countries trying to pull down our higher standards can take conflicts to secret tribunals with three trade judges, who also have corporate clients and can say to the U.S., \u201cGet rid of your protections or pay billions of dollars in tribute.\u201d\n\nThe same noose can choke efforts by the U.S. to upgrade our health, safety, and economic rights. Had air bags been proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation under today\u2019s global trade uber alles regimes, the proposal would have had to go to a harmonization committee of the WTO\u2019s signatory countries that would sandpaper or reject this life-saving technology. Or if the U.S. went it alone, it would expose itself to repeal or pay by car-exporting nations.\n\nFor ten reasons why the TPP is a bad idea for our country and the world see my recent Common Dreams column.\n\nIf this all sounds so outrageous as to strain credulity, go beneath the tip of this iceberg and visit: Global Trade Warch and Flush the TPP. Then, get ready for the battle over the TPP itself in the late autumn. The following are three examples of how to build resistance to an international problem in your local communities.\n\nFirst, send the legislators who supported the fast track handcuffs a CITIZENS\u2019 SUMMONS to appear at a town meeting where you, not they, present the agenda. If the lawmakers think 500 or more determined people will show up, it is very likely they will relent and meet with you. The unions and other groups working to stop the TPP around the country can get their people to attend these town meetings. August is the congressional recess month. The senators and representative will have no excuse to avoid a town meeting with their constituents. For a list of those legislators who need to be focused on, visit \"Stop Fast Track\".\n\nSecond, hustle together some modest money from groups and individuals, rent an empty storefront, plaster the windows with large signs, and start a rumble of civic resistance in all directions. Politicians sometimes shrug off the warnings of losing contributions from unions. What politicians do fear is their inability to control groups of resurgent voters indeterminately expanding from inside their district or state.\n\nSince opposition to TPP reflects a Left-Right alliance in Congress and back home, store fronts spell real worry for politicians. They should worry because they chose not to do their homework for their home country.\n\nThird, hold rallies designed to attract, collectively, hundreds or thousands of people around the country. These rallies could have an array of high-profile speakers and entertainers, as well as workers who have been harmed by past so-called trade agreements. Rallies can bring in new people and start the process of galvanizing them about the many problems with the TPP.\n\nRemember, 75 percent of Americans think that the TPP should be rejected or delayed according to a bipartisan poll from the Wall Street Journal. People know what these \u201cpull\u2013down,\u201d misnamed trade agreements have done in their own communities.

Again, where was the engineering teacher to vouch for Mohammed\u2019s story? Why didn\u2019t Mohammed simply explain himself? The police said that initially, it was \u201cnot immediately evident\u201d that the clock-in-a-case was a class experiment \u2013 perfectly plausible, given that Mohammed built the clock-in-a-case voluntarily, without assignment, and in conjunction with no science fair.\n\nChief Larry Boyd said simply and correctly, \u201cYou can\u2019t take things like that to school\u201d without explanation or assignment in today\u2019s world without it receiving scrutiny.\n\nAnd according to the cops, Ahmed was significantly more cooperative with friendly media than with the police who came to ask some simple questions.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not a coincidence. Ahmed\u2019s father, as Pamela Geller points out, is an anti-Islamophobia media gadfly. He routinely returns to Sudan to run for president; he has debated anti-Koran Florida pastor Terry Jones, partially in order to bring his children to Disneyworld. In 2011, the Washington Post wrote of him:\n\nElhassan, a native of the Sudan who is now an American citizen, likes to call himself a sheik. He wears a cleric\u2019s flowing white robes and claims hundreds of followers throughout Egypt, Sudan and in the United States. But he is unknown as a scholar or holy man in the state he has called home for two decades. Religious leaders in Texas say they have never heard of Elhassan, including the imam at the mosque where he worships.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Ahmed Mohammed\u2019s dad ran to the cameras at the first opportunity. It\u2019s also no surprise that the terror-connected Council on American-Islamic Relations arrived to push the Islamophobia narrative immediately.\n\nBut there\u2019s a long history of detaining science students for experiments administrators don\u2019t understand. Homer Hickam, the subject of the movie October Sky, found himself in handcuffs during the Cold War for starting a forest fire with a rocket he built. And since September 11, such incidents have become more common. As someone who went to a Jewish high school based in Los Angeles and located next to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, police and security regularly evacuated our high school due to bomb threats. If one of the students had brought a device to school in this fashion, the student would have been detained and questioned \u2013 again, in an all-Jewish school.\n\nAnd as Ian Tuttle of National Review has pointed out, America has become extra-paranoid of late: students have been suspended for gun-shaped Pop Tarts, cap guns, finger guns, and saying the word gun, among other grave offenses. And we don\u2019t even need weapons to suspend students anymore: wearing an American flag at the wrong time or donning a Confederate flag t-shirt will do it.\n\nSo why, after the detention and release, did this story become a national one? Why did Obama jump on this story? Why did Hillary jump on this story? Where were they for then-16-year-old Kiera Wilmot of Florida to the White House after she was arrested and suspended in 2013 for bringing an experiment with toilet cleaner and aluminum foil to school? She was black but not Muslim, so it didn\u2019t serve the narrative. They were MIA.\n\nFor years, the Obama administration has pushed the notion that American Muslims are in danger of Islamophobic backlash. But as of 2012, 62.4 percent of all anti-religious hate crimes targeted Jews; 11.6 percent targeted Muslims; as of 2013, anti-Jewish hate crimes represented 60.3 percent of all hate crimes, as opposed to just 13.7 percent for Muslims. That\u2019s a major decline in anti-Islamic hate crimes since 2001, when 55.7 percent of hate crimes were anti-Jewish, and anti-Muslim hate crimes constituted 27.2 percent of all hate crimes.\n\nSo where, exactly, are all the invitations to Jewish students targeted in hate crime incidents?\n\nThey don\u2019t exist, because they don\u2019t help President Obama castigate America as xenophobic and backwards \u2013 and just as importantly, castigate Texans as particularly likely to don white hoods and go hunt down some Sufis.\n\nThe narrative reigns supreme. Ahmed Mohammed brought a clock-in-a-case that looked like a hoax bomb to the uninformed to school; his engineering teacher told him not to show it around; he showed it around; the police showed up, and he was allegedly uncooperative; they decided he was innocent and released him.\n\nThat\u2019s not a national scandal. That\u2019s local cops and teachers and administrators doing their jobs, decently but cautiously. Yet that won\u2019t be what you hear. You\u2019ll just hear that America hates Muslims, even as Americans self-righteously tweet out #IStandWithAhmed without hearing the facts.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).

The whole point of global warming is that it's a rationalization for progressives to do what progressives want to do, which is concentrate more and more power in Washington, more and more Washington power in the executive branch, more and more executive branch power in independent czars and agencies to micromanage the lives of the American people -- our shower heads, our toilets, our bathtubs, our garden hoses. Everything becomes involved in the exigencies of rescuing the planet.\n\n\n\nSecond, global warming is a religion in the sense that it's a series of propositions that can't be refuted. It's very ironic that the global warming alarmists say, \"We are the real defenders of science,\" and then they adopt the absolute reverse of the scientific attitude, which is openness to evidence. You cannot refute what they say.\n\n\n\nI own a house in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, facing the Atlantic, where the hurricanes come from. After Katrina, the global warming people said, \"This is just a sign of the violent weather that's going to become more common because of global warming.\" Well, that certainly interested me. Of course, since then, there's been a collapse of hurricane activity.\n\n\n\nI was a columnist in the 1970s when Newsweek, Time, all sorts of media outlets said the real problem is global cooling. I remember the Washington Post reporting that the armadillos were going south to escape the coming chill, the threat of glaciation over northern Europe. We've been through this before. You say, \"What happened to global cooling?\" They say, \"Well, our models were wrong.\" Now we're supposed to risk several trillion dollars of global growth and spending on new models that might be wrong?\n\n\n\nOne other thing, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produced a report. The New Yorker, which is impeccably alarmed about global warming, the writer being their specialist began her story something like this: \"In a report that should be but unfortunately will not be viewed as the final word in climate science.\" Now, just think about that. The final word in microbiology, the final word in quantum mechanics. There are no final words in science. But there you have the deeply anti-scientific temper of the global warming advocacy groups: Final words."], ["http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/06/25/king-obama-his-royal-court-and-tpp", "Breaking News & Views for the Progressive Community", "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) \u2013 a global corporate noose around U.S. local, state, and national sovereignty \u2013 narrowly passed a major procedural hurdle in the Congress by gaining \u201cfast track\u201d status. This term \u201cfast track\u201d is a euphemism for your members of Congress \u2013 senators and representatives \u2013 handcuffing themselves, so as to prevent any amendments or adequate debate before the final vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 another euphemism that is used to avoid the word \u201ctreaty,\u201d which would require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate. This anti-democratic process is being pushed by \u201cKing Obama\u201d and his royal court.\n\nMake no mistake. If this was only a trade treaty \u2013 reducing tariffs, quotas, and the like \u2013 it would not be so controversial. Yet, the corporate-indentured politicians keep calling this gigantic treaty with thirty chapters, of which only five relate to traditional trade issues, a trade agreement instead of a treaty. The other twenty-four chapters, if passed as they are, will have serious impacts on your livelihoods as workers and consumers, as well as your air, water, food, and medicines\n\nThe reason I call President Obama \u201cKing Obama\u201d in this case is that he, and his massive corporate lobbies (royal court), have sought to circumvent the checks and balances system that is the very bedrock of our government. They have severely weakened the independence of the primary branch of our government \u2013 the Congress\u2014and fought off any court challenges with medieval defenses, such as no American citizen has any standing to sue for harm done by such treaties or the subject is a political, not judicial, matter.\n\nOnly corporations, astonishingly enough, are entitled to sue the U.S. government for any alleged harm to their profits from health, safety or other regulations in secret tribunals that operate as offshore kangaroo courts, not in open courts.\n\nWe Interrupt This Article with an Urgent Message!

President Obama and some members of Congress say that the TPP will be different from NAFTA and the WTO, but I doubt that they have read the entire draft of the TPP. They\u2019re relying on summary memos by the U.S. Trade Office and corporate lawyers, for example, drug companies that sugarcoat the complex monopolistic extension of the pharmaceutical patents and how this will result in higher prices for your medicines.\n\nI challenge President Obama to state publically that he has read the entire TPP. Even a benign monarch would do this for his/her trusting subjects.\n\nInside these hundreds of pages of cross references and repeals of conflicting existing laws is the central subversion, subordinating our protective laws for labor, consumers and the environment (impersonally called \u201cnon-tariff trader barriers\u201d) to the supremacy of international global commercial traffic.\n\nOne very recent example \u2013 by no means the worst possible \u2013 just occurred. After Congress passed a popular \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labeling requirement on meat packages sold in supermarkets, Brazil and Mexico, both exporters of meat to the U.S.A, challenged this U.S. law in a secret (yes, literally secret in all respects) tribunal in Geneva under the World Trade Organization Treaty. Brazil and Mexico won this legal challenge.\n\n\u201cMany Americans will be shocked that the WTO can order our government to deny U.S. consumers the basic information about where their food comes from and that if the information policy is not gutted, we could face millions in sanctions every year,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling spotlights how these so called \u2018trade\u2019 deals are packed with non-trade provisions that threaten our most basic rights, such as even knowing the source and safety of what\u2019s on our dinner plate.\u201d A May 2013 survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that 90% of adult Americans favored this \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d requirement.\n\nFearing billions of dollars in penalties, the U.S. Congress is racing to repeal its own law. See how the noose works: foreign countries trying to pull down our higher standards can take conflicts to secret tribunals with three trade judges, who also have corporate clients and can say to the U.S., \u201cGet rid of your protections or pay billions of dollars in tribute.\u201d\n\nThe same noose can choke efforts by the U.S. to upgrade our health, safety, and economic rights. Had air bags been proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation under today\u2019s global trade uber alles regimes, the proposal would have had to go to a harmonization committee of the WTO\u2019s signatory countries that would sandpaper or reject this life-saving technology. Or if the U.S. went it alone, it would expose itself to repeal or pay by car-exporting nations.\n\nFor ten reasons why the TPP is a bad idea for our country and the world see my recent Common Dreams column.\n\nIf this all sounds so outrageous as to strain credulity, go beneath the tip of this iceberg and visit: Global Trade Warch and Flush the TPP. Then, get ready for the battle over the TPP itself in the late autumn. The following are three examples of how to build resistance to an international problem in your local communities.\n\nFirst, send the legislators who supported the fast track handcuffs a CITIZENS\u2019 SUMMONS to appear at a town meeting where you, not they, present the agenda. If the lawmakers think 500 or more determined people will show up, it is very likely they will relent and meet with you. The unions and other groups working to stop the TPP around the country can get their people to attend these town meetings. August is the congressional recess month. The senators and representative will have no excuse to avoid a town meeting with their constituents. For a list of those legislators who need to be focused on, visit \"Stop Fast Track\".\n\nSecond, hustle together some modest money from groups and individuals, rent an empty storefront, plaster the windows with large signs, and start a rumble of civic resistance in all directions. Politicians sometimes shrug off the warnings of losing contributions from unions. What politicians do fear is their inability to control groups of resurgent voters indeterminately expanding from inside their district or state.\n\nSince opposition to TPP reflects a Left-Right alliance in Congress and back home, store fronts spell real worry for politicians. They should worry because they chose not to do their homework for their home country.\n\nThird, hold rallies designed to attract, collectively, hundreds or thousands of people around the country. These rallies could have an array of high-profile speakers and entertainers, as well as workers who have been harmed by past so-called trade agreements. Rallies can bring in new people and start the process of galvanizing them about the many problems with the TPP.\n\nRemember, 75 percent of Americans think that the TPP should be rejected or delayed according to a bipartisan poll from the Wall Street Journal. People know what these \u201cpull\u2013down,\u201d misnamed trade agreements have done in their own communities.

It caught a moment, summarised the space age and encouraged a style of spindliness and volume that shaped motels and table lamps.\n\nLike the best icons, it wasn\u2019t designed for effect but for the fearsome expediencies of the race between the USSR and the US to put the first manmade object into orbit, and for the changed physical rules of the previously unknown world outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. At the same time it was part of a movement already decades old at the time that the first Sputnik was launched in 1957, which combined fantasy and image with function and science. In the Science Museum\u2019s Cosmonauts exhibition, which covers Russia\u2019s fascination with space from late tsarist times to the present, it is possible to see the country\u2019s extraterrestrial exploration as a vast art project.\n\nExhibits include early abstract paintings representing new cosmic orders and Konstantin Yuon\u2019s New Planet, a 1921 painting intended for the drop curtain of the Bolshoi theatre, where the October revolution is shown as a previously unknown world, floating amid strange spheres and bursts of radiant light. There is also the 1928 Labour Commune by an architecture student called Georgy Krutikov, a series of circular space stations that formed part of his atomic-powered Flying City project. Space was seen as a place where the revolutionary project of a perfect society could reach fulfilment.\n\nA key figure is Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a bearded provincial schoolteacher, almost completely deaf, who wielded a vast ear trumpet of his own design and manufacture and who from the late 1870s until his death in 1935 studied questions of weightlessness and space travel, and tried to communicate them through science fiction. The exhibition shows his notes and sketches for a 1930s film called Cosmic Voyage, on which he was a consultant. Their style has a schoolboy naivety, but they show insights into the ways and means of reaching space, including escape velocity, fuel, and the use of multi-stage rockets remarkably close to those that would eventually be employed.\n\nCosmic Voyage, 1935\n\nTsiolkovsky and others followed the frankly bonkers philosophy of Cosmism, which proposed immortality and resurrection through science. Yet his ideas of space travel became reality through the efforts of another hero of the exhibition, Sergei Korolev, who despite spending some years in the Gulag drove forward the Soviet programme that put the first object, animal, man and woman into space. At which point exploration became a tool of geopolitical propaganda, giving rise to monuments and celebratory posters.\n\nThe most remarkable pieces in this gripping show are the technical equipment, the capsules, landers and probes, not to mention the pressurised trousers, space suits and control tables, that have the profound strangeness that comes from addressing huge and unusual technical challenges. Some of them baked by the heat of re-entry, they can look strikingly primitive as well as technologically wondrous. Their weirdness is beyond anything that the wildest dreamers could have conceived. At the same time the art and design that inspired the space programme and was inspired by it, from 1920s abstraction to Sputnik-shaped souvenir samovars, shows how science is anything but pure, but is embedded in the societies from which it comes.\n\nOne thing beyond the Cosmists\u2019 fertile imagination would have been that, in the 21st century, considerable care would have been taken to restore a wrecked relic of the 19th to regular use, while retaining its character of wrecked-ness. This is what has happened to Wilton\u2019s Music Hall in east London, a rare survivor that flourished in its original use for little more than 20 years, was taken over by Methodists and, since it was listed in 1971, has undertaken a slow journey to a renovation. Performances started there again in the 1990s, but it is only under the leadership of its current director, Frances Mayhew, that it has reached a position where it can deliver a regular programme into a relatively secure future. In 2004 Mayhew rescued it from possible abandonment or, worse, a takeover by Wetherspoons, and has been championing it ever since.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The carefully restored Wilton\u2019s Music Hall, which has retained \u2018its character of wrecked-ness\u2019. Photograph: Helene Binet\n\nThe complex consists of a row of houses that once contained a pub, which was acquired by the eponymous John Wilton, who than added a purpose-built auditorium at the back where, rather than face the stage in solemn rows, customers could eat and drink and be entertained by performers as much or as little as they desired. The auditorium reopened in 2013; the remaking of the former houses, to include a rambling array of rooms, bars, offices, rehearsal space, and some of open-ended purposes is now complete. It is not precisely going back to those days, but it is reviving a spirit of looseness, in which several ways of using the theatre are possible, and in which the common spaces of the old houses can be inhabited and activated, also in multiple ways. Performance is not confined to a designated zone, but can happen almost anywhere.\n\nThe appeal of Wilton\u2019s, ever since Fiona Shaw and Deborah Warner put on TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land there in 1997, has been its fragility, the feeling that it might not be there tomorrow, which at the time was almost true. With the latest work, the architect Tim Ronalds has had to spend \u00a34m on ensuring its actual permanence, without losing this vital quality. Crude brickwork, not originally intended to be seen, is therefore left unplastered, as are Victorian lash-ups of reused railway track and cement. There are spaces that seem to have escaped from a Gustave Dor\u00e9 engraving, others that look almost medieval. The auditorium is coated in worn layers of paint, mysterious and apparently venerable, but actually the residue of 1990s performance and film shoots such as Richard Attenborough\u2019s Chaplin.\n\nThis ruinenlust would have been beyond the comprehension of John Wilton, for whom the object was to create a palatial, chandelier-lit escape from the grotty reality of its surroundings. The current Wilton\u2019s is different, but it still draws on the aspirations of the original, expressed in its slender barley-sugar columns and ornamental bas-reliefs on the bar. Its magic now comes from the dreaming and the crumbling together: a replication of the original decor would only have been kitsch. It is a construction of multiple layers of fiction, accrued over time.

Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:"], ["http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/greeks-vote-early-elections-33891079?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Greeks Vote Once More in Early Elections", "Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national polls this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party, which made pledges to implement austerity measures in return for billions of euros in rescue loans, was marginally ahead of the rival center-right New Democracy in opinion polls leading up to the vote.\n\nBut the surveys, which showed many of the 9.9 million voters were undecided until two days before the vote or might abstain altogether, indicated the winner would not have enough votes to form a government alone.\n\nEarly turnout appeared low Sunday \u2014 a warm summer day that could tempt vote-weary Greeks to opt for the beach instead of casting yet another ballot.\n\nTsipras, 41, triggered the election by resigning barely seven months into his four-year term, after facing a rebellion within Syriza over his policy U-turn in accepting the spending cuts and tax hikes stipulated by the bailout. Tsipras had won January elections on pledges of abolishing such measures, tied to Greece's first two bailouts.\n\nHe has argued he had no choice but to accept the demands of European creditors for more tax hikes and spending cuts in return for Greece's third rescue, a three-year package worth 86 billion euros ($97 billion). He had vowed to repeal the measures imposed in return for the country's first two bailouts \u2014 and despite winning a referendum he hastily called July 5 urging Greeks to reject creditor reform proposals.\n\nBut without the third bailout, Greece \u2014 which has relied on international rescue loans since 2010 \u2014 faced bankruptcy and a potentially disastrous exit from Europe's joint currency.\n\nTsipras called on Greeks to give the next government a strong mandate that will allow it to govern for a full four-year term and to \"continue with the same decisiveness, the same self-denial to fight the battles for the defense of our people's rights, not only in Europe but this time within the country too.\"\n\n\"I am optimistic,\" Tsipras said after voting in his working class Kypseli neighborhood of Athens. \"Tomorrow a new day starts.\"\n\nThe danger of being forced out of the euro \u2014 and possibly even the European Union itself \u2014 was on many voters' minds as they cast their ballots.\n\n\"My conditions are that we remain in Europe and nothing else, because under no circumstances can we exit,\" said retiree Elektra Kadydou as she voted in a central Athens polling center.\n\nThe campaign has been lackluster and somewhat muted \u2014 a far cry from the frenetic, high-stakes January campaign, which pitted the anti-bailout Tsipras against centrist parties that argued the deal with other Eurozone countries was the country's best chance for an eventual return to some form of economic normalcy in a country ravaged by recession and with unemployment at around 25 percent.\n\nNow, the policies for whichever party wins have already been set in the form of the bailout agreement, and the anti-bailout camp has been reduced to the Nazi-inspired extreme right-wing Golden Dawn and the new Popular Unity, formed last month by rebel Syriza lawmakers who split from the party and led by former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis.\n\nThe campaign of Tsipras' main rival, New Democracy's 61-year-old Vangelis Meimarakis, has centered on a return to stability. He painted Tsipras as a reckless, inexperienced politician who led the country toward a potential catastrophe and introduced strict banking restrictions in an effort to stem a bank run.\n\nSyriza's campaign has focused on doing away with the staid and often corrupt politics of the past.\n\n\"Today the politicians don't speak, the citizens speak. They speak with their vote,\" Meimarakis said after casting his ballot in a northern Athens suburb. \"And I think they want to do away with the grey, the lies, the misery .... And with their vote they want to bring truth and authenticity, so we can have a better tomorrow, a better tomorrow for all Greeks.\"\n\nThe government that emerges will have little time to waste. Creditors are expected to review progress of reforms as part of the bailout next month, while the government will also have to draft the 2016 state budget, overhaul the pension system, raise a series of taxes, including on farmers, carry out privatizations and merge social security funds.\n\nIt must also oversee a critical bank recapitalization program, without which depositors with over 100,000 euros ($113,000) in their accounts will be forced to contribute.\n\nPolls have indicated no party is anywhere near the levels needed for an overall parliamentary majority of 151 seats in the 300-member legislature, even with the 50-seat bonus given to the winner, and a three-party coalition would likely be required. That should be achievable with help from two centrist pro-European small parties: the formerly mighty socialist PASOK, and relative newcomer To Potami, or The River.\n\nSpeaking after casting his ballot, To Potami leader Stavros Theodorakis urged Greeks not to abstain, and said the prospect of a repeat election must be avoided. That would occur if no parties manage to agree on forming a coalition government.\n\nGolden Dawn, whose leadership is on trial on charges of running a criminal organization, has been consistently polling in third place, but would not be approached by any of the other parties to form a coalition.\n\nNine parties have a chance of reaching the 3 percent threshold needed to enter parliament. The total number of parties getting in will affect seat distribution \u2014 the more parties, the fewer seats for the winner, increasing the need for one or more coalition partners.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) and final results are expected by early Monday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIdyli Tsakiri in Athens contributed.Giving a mandate for a strong government with a 4 year horizon that the country needs, but also for a fighting government that will continue with the same decisiveness, the same self-denial to fight the battles for the defence of our people's rights , not only in Europe but this time within the country too."], ["http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/italian-coach-hebron-upends-palestinian-soccer-league-33892643?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Italian Coach in Hebron Upends Palestinian Soccer League", "Throughout his long career, Stefano Cusin has played in Italy, France and Switzerland and coached in Bulgaria, Cameroon and the Congo. But the 46-year-old, Tuscany-born Cusin says it's only in the Palestinian soccer backwater of Hebron that he has truly rediscovered his passion for the sport.\n\n\"I've discovered again the pleasure to train, to play football, the passion,\" he said. \"We've found a group of great guys who were eager to learn and for a trainer this is the most beautiful thing ... I was looking for a challenge, something different, less money but with a big challenge.\"\n\nHis arrival on the scene has also transformed the fortunes of scrappy perennial loser al-Ahli al-Khalil. He took a team with a $1 million annual budget raised mostly from donations to a European training camp where they played friendlies against superior competition. In just nine months, al-Ahli al-Khalil has notched four separate titles and Cusin has become a hero in the city.\n\n\"The al-Ahli al-Khalil football team wasn't a strong one in Palestinian league, we were like any other Palestinian local team,\" said defender Abdullah Jaber, one of two Palestinian national team members on the squad. \"But after Stefano started coaching us he changed the players' way of thinking and turned them into professionals.\"\n\nCusin instilled a tough regime, locking the players in a stringent training program that gives them only one day off a week. He introduced video sessions as part of the training. The Italian, who arrived in Hebron from a coaching stint in the United Arab Emirates, calls his success with al-Ahli al-Khalil a \"fortunate and winning encounter.\"\n\nCusin, who speaks Italian, French and English, mostly communicates with his players through a translator but he's picked up a few essential Arabic words so he can bark orders like \"move,\" ''faster\" and \"go.\"\n\nHis players might not be in the European big leagues, but Cusin said living in a conflict area provides a different sort of spirit.\n\n\"Since they have to fight every day, they take this to the field. These teams don't let go for the whole 90 minutes,\" he said. \"When you play football, you need an angry player and the Palestinian people know how to fight because they have to fight every day against Israel.\"\n\nCusin shares some of the daily hardships such as needing to use long bypass roads to travel through the West Bank. He also had to leave his family behind in Italy because there are no international schools for his son in Hebron. Otherwise, he said he steers clear of politics and has found other significance to coaching the Palestinian team.\n\n\"I want to win. Ever since I was a child I've liked the underdog that beats the big teams. So this explains my choice,\" he said, adding that his success has made up for being away from family and good restaurants.\n\nCusin is joined by a small Italian staff that includes assistant coach Davide Tentoni and trainer Gianluca Sorini. Tentoni, in his first experience abroad, said the Palestinian players are taking soccer back to its roots.\n\n\"There's no shrewdness, there's no use of tactics. Here they play from the first to the 90th minute to win and score. So if they're winning 3-0, it's not that they stop because they're winning 3-0, they want to score the fourth, the fifth (goal),\" he said. \"Their way of playing is a bit like a child's game.

Malaysian officials contend the payments are part of an arrangement under which the sultanate has ceded the 74,000 square kilometers (28,000 square miles) of Sabah territory to their country.\n\nThe Kiram sultanate, which emerged in the 1400s, built a legend for its wide influence at the time and its feared Tausug warriors. Chinese and European leaders once sent vassals to pay homage to their powerful forebears. The Sulu sultanate preceded both the Philippine republic and Malaysia by centuries, Idjirani said.\n\nOverrun by history, however, the Kirams now carry royal titles and nothing much else. The sultanate has about 75,000 followers in Sulu and outlying islands that are among the country's poorest regions and are troubled by Muslim rebels, al-Qaida-linked extremists and outlaws.\n\nKiram was buried Sunday in Sulu's Maimbung town, where he had lived, with government forces providing security. A bomb explosion damaged Maimbung's police station late Saturday, but the attack was unrelated to his death and may have been staged by Abu Sayyaf militants, who have been targeted in a new military offensive, Sulu military commander Brig. Gen. Alan Arrojado said.\n\nKiram led the sultanate since the early 2000s, backed by an elder brother, Jamalul, who had relocated to Manila and died in 2013.\n\nKiram's successor will be a younger brother, Phugdal Kiram, a retired grade school teacher, Idjirani said.\n\nPhilippine presidents have relegated the volatile territorial feud to the backburner despite efforts by the Kirams to put it on the national agenda."], ["http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-boat-migrants-sinks-greece-26-missing-33891330?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "The Latest: Different Handling of Migrants on Hungary Border", "The latest developments as European governments rush to cope with the huge number of people moving across Europe.

It stinks of leftist exploitation.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know. On Monday, Mohammed brought a homemade clock to school. For those who don\u2019t know the ins-and-outs of electronics, the device looked like a possible incendiary device. Ahmed told the media that he made the clock last weekend and brought it to school to show his engineering teacher. He explained to local news, \u201cIt was the first time I brought an invention to school to show a teacher.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t explain that to police, however, according to the authorities. And he didn\u2019t just show the device to his engineering teacher. In fact, the engineering teacher told him not to carry the device around after Mohammed showed him, according to The New York Times:\n\nHe said he took it to school on Monday to show an engineering teacher, who said it was nice but then told him he should not show the invention to other teachers. Later, Ahmed\u2019s clock beeped during an English class, and after he revealed the device to the teacher, school officials notified the police, and Ahmed was interrogated by officers. \u201cShe thought it was a threat to her,\u201d Ahmed told reporters Wednesday. \u201cSo it was really sad that she took a wrong impression of it.\u201d\n\nWhy was the device in English class in the first place, especially after the engineering teacher told him not to show it around? When confronted by police and his English teacher, why didn\u2019t Mohammed just tell them to talk to the engineering teacher? When police asked Ahmed what the device was and why he brought it to school, according to WFAA:\n\nOfficers said Ahmed was being \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d in his answers to their questions, and didn\u2019t have a \u201creasonable answer\u201d as to what he was doing with the case. Investigators said the student told them that it was just a clock that he was messing around with. \u201cWe attempted to question the juvenile about what it was and he would simply only say it was a clock. He didn\u2019t offer any explanation as to what it was for, why he created this device, why he brought it to school,\u201d said James McLellan, Irving Police.\n\nHere\u2019s the statute Ahmed Mohammed authorities originally suspected Mohammed of violating (Texas Penal Code Section 46.08):\n\n(a) A person commits an offense if the person knowingly manufactures, sells, purchases, transports, or possesses a hoax bomb with intent to use the hoax bomb to: (1) make another believe that the hoax bomb is an explosive or incendiary device; or (2) cause alarm or reaction of any type by an official of a public safety agency or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies. (b) An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nNobody said Mohammed built an actual bomb. They suspected that he had wanted to frighten or alarm officials with a hoax-bomb. When they found out he didn\u2019t intend to do that, they released him.\n\nGiven the limited evidence available, this is not far-fetched. Again, where was the engineering teacher to vouch for Mohammed\u2019s story? Why didn\u2019t Mohammed simply explain himself? The police said that initially, it was \u201cnot immediately evident\u201d that the clock-in-a-case was a class experiment \u2013 perfectly plausible, given that Mohammed built the clock-in-a-case voluntarily, without assignment, and in conjunction with no science fair.\n\nChief Larry Boyd said simply and correctly, \u201cYou can\u2019t take things like that to school\u201d without explanation or assignment in today\u2019s world without it receiving scrutiny.\n\nAnd according to the cops, Ahmed was significantly more cooperative with friendly media than with the police who came to ask some simple questions.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not a coincidence. Ahmed\u2019s father, as Pamela Geller points out, is an anti-Islamophobia media gadfly. He routinely returns to Sudan to run for president; he has debated anti-Koran Florida pastor Terry Jones, partially in order to bring his children to Disneyworld. In 2011, the Washington Post wrote of him:\n\nElhassan, a native of the Sudan who is now an American citizen, likes to call himself a sheik. He wears a cleric\u2019s flowing white robes and claims hundreds of followers throughout Egypt, Sudan and in the United States. But he is unknown as a scholar or holy man in the state he has called home for two decades. Religious leaders in Texas say they have never heard of Elhassan, including the imam at the mosque where he worships.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Ahmed Mohammed\u2019s dad ran to the cameras at the first opportunity. It\u2019s also no surprise that the terror-connected Council on American-Islamic Relations arrived to push the Islamophobia narrative immediately.\n\nBut there\u2019s a long history of detaining science students for experiments administrators don\u2019t understand. Homer Hickam, the subject of the movie October Sky, found himself in handcuffs during the Cold War for starting a forest fire with a rocket he built. And since September 11, such incidents have become more common. As someone who went to a Jewish high school based in Los Angeles and located next to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, police and security regularly evacuated our high school due to bomb threats. If one of the students had brought a device to school in this fashion, the student would have been detained and questioned \u2013 again, in an all-Jewish school.\n\nAnd as Ian Tuttle of National Review has pointed out, America has become extra-paranoid of late: students have been suspended for gun-shaped Pop Tarts, cap guns, finger guns, and saying the word gun, among other grave offenses. And we don\u2019t even need weapons to suspend students anymore: wearing an American flag at the wrong time or donning a Confederate flag t-shirt will do it.\n\nSo why, after the detention and release, did this story become a national one? Why did Obama jump on this story? Why did Hillary jump on this story? Where were they for then-16-year-old Kiera Wilmot of Florida to the White House after she was arrested and suspended in 2013 for bringing an experiment with toilet cleaner and aluminum foil to school? She was black but not Muslim, so it didn\u2019t serve the narrative. They were MIA.\n\nFor years, the Obama administration has pushed the notion that American Muslims are in danger of Islamophobic backlash. But as of 2012, 62.4 percent of all anti-religious hate crimes targeted Jews; 11.6 percent targeted Muslims; as of 2013, anti-Jewish hate crimes represented 60.3 percent of all hate crimes, as opposed to just 13.7 percent for Muslims. That\u2019s a major decline in anti-Islamic hate crimes since 2001, when 55.7 percent of hate crimes were anti-Jewish, and anti-Muslim hate crimes constituted 27.2 percent of all hate crimes.\n\nSo where, exactly, are all the invitations to Jewish students targeted in hate crime incidents?\n\nThey don\u2019t exist, because they don\u2019t help President Obama castigate America as xenophobic and backwards \u2013 and just as importantly, castigate Texans as particularly likely to don white hoods and go hunt down some Sufis.\n\nThe narrative reigns supreme. Ahmed Mohammed brought a clock-in-a-case that looked like a hoax bomb to the uninformed to school; his engineering teacher told him not to show it around; he showed it around; the police showed up, and he was allegedly uncooperative; they decided he was innocent and released him.\n\nThat\u2019s not a national scandal. That\u2019s local cops and teachers and administrators doing their jobs, decently but cautiously. Yet that won\u2019t be what you hear. You\u2019ll just hear that America hates Muslims, even as Americans self-righteously tweet out #IStandWithAhmed without hearing the facts.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).

We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:"], ["http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/greeks-vote-early-elections-33891079?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Greeks Vote Once More in Early Elections", "Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national polls this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party, which made pledges to implement austerity measures in return for billions of euros in rescue loans, was marginally ahead of the rival center-right New Democracy in opinion polls leading up to the vote.\n\nBut the surveys, which showed many of the 9.9 million voters were undecided until two days before the vote or might abstain altogether, indicated the winner would not have enough votes to form a government alone.\n\nEarly turnout appeared low Sunday \u2014 a warm summer day that could tempt vote-weary Greeks to opt for the beach instead of casting yet another ballot.\n\nTsipras, 41, triggered the election by resigning barely seven months into his four-year term, after facing a rebellion within Syriza over his policy U-turn in accepting the spending cuts and tax hikes stipulated by the bailout. Tsipras had won January elections on pledges of abolishing such measures, tied to Greece's first two bailouts.\n\nHe has argued he had no choice but to accept the demands of European creditors for more tax hikes and spending cuts in return for Greece's third rescue, a three-year package worth 86 billion euros ($97 billion). He had vowed to repeal the measures imposed in return for the country's first two bailouts \u2014 and despite winning a referendum he hastily called July 5 urging Greeks to reject creditor reform proposals.\n\nBut without the third bailout, Greece \u2014 which has relied on international rescue loans since 2010 \u2014 faced bankruptcy and a potentially disastrous exit from Europe's joint currency.\n\nTsipras called on Greeks to give the next government a strong mandate that will allow it to govern for a full four-year term and to \"continue with the same decisiveness, the same self-denial to fight the battles for the defense of our people's rights, not only in Europe but this time within the country too.\"\n\n\"I am optimistic,\" Tsipras said after voting in his working class Kypseli neighborhood of Athens. \"Tomorrow a new day starts.\"\n\nThe danger of being forced out of the euro \u2014 and possibly even the European Union itself \u2014 was on many voters' minds as they cast their ballots.\n\n\"My conditions are that we remain in Europe and nothing else, because under no circumstances can we exit,\" said retiree Elektra Kadydou as she voted in a central Athens polling center.\n\nThe campaign has been lackluster and somewhat muted \u2014 a far cry from the frenetic, high-stakes January campaign, which pitted the anti-bailout Tsipras against centrist parties that argued the deal with other Eurozone countries was the country's best chance for an eventual return to some form of economic normalcy in a country ravaged by recession and with unemployment at around 25 percent.\n\nNow, the policies for whichever party wins have already been set in the form of the bailout agreement, and the anti-bailout camp has been reduced to the Nazi-inspired extreme right-wing Golden Dawn and the new Popular Unity, formed last month by rebel Syriza lawmakers who split from the party and led by former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis.\n\nThe campaign of Tsipras' main rival, New Democracy's 61-year-old Vangelis Meimarakis, has centered on a return to stability. He painted Tsipras as a reckless, inexperienced politician who led the country toward a potential catastrophe and introduced strict banking restrictions in an effort to stem a bank run.\n\nSyriza's campaign has focused on doing away with the staid and often corrupt politics of the past.\n\n\"Today the politicians don't speak, the citizens speak. They speak with their vote,\" Meimarakis said after casting his ballot in a northern Athens suburb. \"And I think they want to do away with the grey, the lies, the misery .... And with their vote they want to bring truth and authenticity, so we can have a better tomorrow, a better tomorrow for all Greeks.\"\n\nThe government that emerges will have little time to waste. Creditors are expected to review progress of reforms as part of the bailout next month, while the government will also have to draft the 2016 state budget, overhaul the pension system, raise a series of taxes, including on farmers, carry out privatizations and merge social security funds.\n\nIt must also oversee a critical bank recapitalization program, without which depositors with over 100,000 euros ($113,000) in their accounts will be forced to contribute.\n\nPolls have indicated no party is anywhere near the levels needed for an overall parliamentary majority of 151 seats in the 300-member legislature, even with the 50-seat bonus given to the winner, and a three-party coalition would likely be required. That should be achievable with help from two centrist pro-European small parties: the formerly mighty socialist PASOK, and relative newcomer To Potami, or The River.\n\nSpeaking after casting his ballot, To Potami leader Stavros Theodorakis urged Greeks not to abstain, and said the prospect of a repeat election must be avoided. That would occur if no parties manage to agree on forming a coalition government.\n\nGolden Dawn, whose leadership is on trial on charges of running a criminal organization, has been consistently polling in third place, but would not be approached by any of the other parties to form a coalition.\n\nNine parties have a chance of reaching the 3 percent threshold needed to enter parliament. The total number of parties getting in will affect seat distribution \u2014 the more parties, the fewer seats for the winner, increasing the need for one or more coalition partners.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) and final results are expected by early Monday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIdyli Tsakiri in Athens contributed.Giving a mandate for a strong government with a 4 year horizon that the country needs, but also for a fighting government that will continue with the same decisiveness, the same self-denial to fight the battles for the defence of our people's rights , not only in Europe but this time within the country too."], ["http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/italian-coach-hebron-upends-palestinian-soccer-league-33892643?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Italian Coach in Hebron Upends Palestinian Soccer League", "Throughout his long career, Stefano Cusin has played in Italy, France and Switzerland and coached in Bulgaria, Cameroon and the Congo.

He introduced video sessions as part of the training. The Italian, who arrived in Hebron from a coaching stint in the United Arab Emirates, calls his success with al-Ahli al-Khalil a \"fortunate and winning encounter.\"\n\nCusin, who speaks Italian, French and English, mostly communicates with his players through a translator but he's picked up a few essential Arabic words so he can bark orders like \"move,\" ''faster\" and \"go.\"\n\nHis players might not be in the European big leagues, but Cusin said living in a conflict area provides a different sort of spirit.\n\n\"Since they have to fight every day, they take this to the field. These teams don't let go for the whole 90 minutes,\" he said. \"When you play football, you need an angry player and the Palestinian people know how to fight because they have to fight every day against Israel.\"\n\nCusin shares some of the daily hardships such as needing to use long bypass roads to travel through the West Bank. He also had to leave his family behind in Italy because there are no international schools for his son in Hebron. Otherwise, he said he steers clear of politics and has found other significance to coaching the Palestinian team.\n\n\"I want to win. Ever since I was a child I've liked the underdog that beats the big teams. So this explains my choice,\" he said, adding that his success has made up for being away from family and good restaurants.\n\nCusin is joined by a small Italian staff that includes assistant coach Davide Tentoni and trainer Gianluca Sorini. Tentoni, in his first experience abroad, said the Palestinian players are taking soccer back to its roots.\n\n\"There's no shrewdness, there's no use of tactics.

Malaysian officials contend the payments are part of an arrangement under which the sultanate has ceded the 74,000 square kilometers (28,000 square miles) of Sabah territory to their country.\n\nThe Kiram sultanate, which emerged in the 1400s, built a legend for its wide influence at the time and its feared Tausug warriors. Chinese and European leaders once sent vassals to pay homage to their powerful forebears. The Sulu sultanate preceded both the Philippine republic and Malaysia by centuries, Idjirani said.\n\nOverrun by history, however, the Kirams now carry royal titles and nothing much else. The sultanate has about 75,000 followers in Sulu and outlying islands that are among the country's poorest regions and are troubled by Muslim rebels, al-Qaida-linked extremists and outlaws.\n\nKiram was buried Sunday in Sulu's Maimbung town, where he had lived, with government forces providing security. A bomb explosion damaged Maimbung's police station late Saturday, but the attack was unrelated to his death and may have been staged by Abu Sayyaf militants, who have been targeted in a new military offensive, Sulu military commander Brig. Gen. Alan Arrojado said.\n\nKiram led the sultanate since the early 2000s, backed by an elder brother, Jamalul, who had relocated to Manila and died in 2013.\n\nKiram's successor will be a younger brother, Phugdal Kiram, a retired grade school teacher, Idjirani said.\n\nPhilippine presidents have relegated the volatile territorial feud to the backburner despite efforts by the Kirams to put it on the national agenda."], ["http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-boat-migrants-sinks-greece-26-missing-33891330?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "The Latest: Different Handling of Migrants on Hungary Border", "The latest developments as European governments rush to cope with the huge number of people moving across Europe.

President Obama and some members of Congress say that the TPP will be different from NAFTA and the WTO, but I doubt that they have read the entire draft of the TPP. They\u2019re relying on summary memos by the U.S. Trade Office and corporate lawyers, for example, drug companies that sugarcoat the complex monopolistic extension of the pharmaceutical patents and how this will result in higher prices for your medicines.\n\nI challenge President Obama to state publically that he has read the entire TPP. Even a benign monarch would do this for his/her trusting subjects.\n\nInside these hundreds of pages of cross references and repeals of conflicting existing laws is the central subversion, subordinating our protective laws for labor, consumers and the environment (impersonally called \u201cnon-tariff trader barriers\u201d) to the supremacy of international global commercial traffic.\n\nOne very recent example \u2013 by no means the worst possible \u2013 just occurred. After Congress passed a popular \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labeling requirement on meat packages sold in supermarkets, Brazil and Mexico, both exporters of meat to the U.S.A, challenged this U.S. law in a secret (yes, literally secret in all respects) tribunal in Geneva under the World Trade Organization Treaty.

See how the noose works: foreign countries trying to pull down our higher standards can take conflicts to secret tribunals with three trade judges, who also have corporate clients and can say to the U.S., \u201cGet rid of your protections or pay billions of dollars in tribute.\u201d\n\nThe same noose can choke efforts by the U.S. to upgrade our health, safety, and economic rights.

Or if the U.S. went it alone, it would expose itself to repeal or pay by car-exporting nations.\n\nFor ten reasons why the TPP is a bad idea for our country and the world see my recent Common Dreams column.\n\nIf this all sounds so outrageous as to strain credulity, go beneath the tip of this iceberg and visit: Global Trade Warch and Flush the TPP. Then, get ready for the battle over the TPP itself in the late autumn. The following are three examples of how to build resistance to an international problem in your local communities.\n\nFirst, send the legislators who supported the fast track handcuffs a CITIZENS\u2019 SUMMONS to appear at a town meeting where you, not they, present the agenda. If the lawmakers think 500 or more determined people will show up, it is very likely they will relent and meet with you. The unions and other groups working to stop the TPP around the country can get their people to attend these town meetings. August is the congressional recess month. The senators and representative will have no excuse to avoid a town meeting with their constituents. For a list of those legislators who need to be focused on, visit \"Stop Fast Track\".\n\nSecond, hustle together some modest money from groups and individuals, rent an empty storefront, plaster the windows with large signs, and start a rumble of civic resistance in all directions. Politicians sometimes shrug off the warnings of losing contributions from unions. What politicians do fear is their inability to control groups of resurgent voters indeterminately expanding from inside their district or state.\n\nSince opposition to TPP reflects a Left-Right alliance in Congress and back home, store fronts spell real worry for politicians. They should worry because they chose not to do their homework for their home country.\n\nThird, hold rallies designed to attract, collectively, hundreds or thousands of people around the country. These rallies could have an array of high-profile speakers and entertainers, as well as workers who have been harmed by past so-called trade agreements. Rallies can bring in new people and start the process of galvanizing them about the many problems with the TPP.\n\nRemember, 75 percent of Americans think that the TPP should be rejected or delayed according to a bipartisan poll from the Wall Street Journal.

Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in.

Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights.

While millions of Americans are eligible for VA care, almost no one uses it if they can possibly get private health insurance or Medicare.\n\nThe most recent scandal involves VA employees creating two waiting lists: the official list is meant to show the Medical Center is meeting the agency\u2019s policy of vets being able to get professional medical help within 14 days of making a request. The other, secret list has the names of those who are waiting to be put on the official list.\n\nSome 40 vets allegedly died while on the waiting list of the VA facility in Phoenix, Ariz.\n\nNow, a growing number of VA Medical Centers have been implicated in similar practices\u2014in Arizona, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Texas and North Carolina. But these are only the latest in a string of scandals.\n\nLast year, House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) held hearings around the country to hear veterans tell about their government-provided VA health care\u2014the same government that is now overseeing everyone\u2019s health care under Obamacare.\n\nThere were whistleblowers complaining of poor sterilization practices and reusing of implements that should have been discarded, infecting vets with HIV; long delays in treating patients; and a backlog of more than 400,000 vets who had filed disability claims that had yet to be processed.\n\nOh, and U.S. News and World Report pointed out, \u201cSince 2008, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have spent over $1 billion to create an integrated electronic health record. Four years and $1 billion later, not a single line of code has been implemented.\u201d\n\nOf course, once the inefficiencies, cost overruns, lies, fraud and abuse are exposed, the government employees responsible run for cover\u2014or should I say \u201ccover-up.\u201d You saw a similar scurrying during the Obamacare website rollout when nothing worked and everyone blamed everyone else\u2014and no one was held accountable.\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki is now on the hot seat, with some Republicans calling for his resignation. In fairness to Shinseki, the VA has had access and quality problems for decades\u2014but we also knew about them. If VA employees engaged in cover-ups, that falls squarely at the secretary\u2019s feet, especially since Rep. Miller highlighted some of these problems last year.\n\nIf my opinion, if the allegations are true, the guilty should be held on involuntary manslaughter charges. But my guess is everyone will get off scot free, perhaps allowing them to retire\u2014with benefits and maybe bonuses. Can you say \u201cLois Lerner\u201d?\n\nPlease, can someone in this scandal-ridden Obama administration finally be held accountable for something? If a dead U.S. ambassador isn\u2019t enough, what about 40 dead veterans?\n\nBut instead of raising the level of care for our vets, Obamacare only drags the rest of us down to the VA level. There will not be enough money to go around\u2014there never is in government-run health care systems\u2014and so cuts and rationing will come to everyone. Patients will be harmed and some will die.\n\nAnd the real culprit, President Obama, will likely get a pass because liberals and the media will praise him for providing access to all\u2014just like the VA."], ["http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-me-politics-boxer-fiorina-story.html", "Sen.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

It was more like Darkness at Noon. Jeb Bush did call for the party to embrace a Reaganesque sense of optimism, which he contrasted with \u201cthe Donald Trump approach of \u2018Everything is bad, everything is coming to an end.\u201d But with occasional exceptions, usually involving the softer-edged John Kasich, the Trump approach dominated. For five hours, the candidates stood in front of Reagan\u2019s plane and described America as a declining nation in a dystopic world, as they pledged, to borrow a phrase, to Make America Great Again.\n\nThe big question of 2016 could well be whether Americans agree with the Republican portrait of Obama-era malaise. It was taken for granted last night that the national debt is out of control, the economy is deteriorating, the government is corrupt, and the world, as Lindsey Graham put it, is \u201con fire.\u201d Rubio complained that \u201cour left-wing government is undermining all the institutions that support the family.\u201d Ted Cruz declared that the Iran nuclear deal would turn the Obama administration into the world\u2019s largest financier of Islamic terror. Chris Christie said the middle class \u201cis getting plowed over by Barack Obama.\u201d The one thing the Republicans didn\u2019t seem too concerned about was climate change, which they agreed was not a problem worthy of solutions that might increase utility bills at a time when average Americans, as Rick Santorum put it, \u201care losing ground.\u201d\n\nObama provided an alternative view yesterday before the debate, making the case before the Business Roundtable that \u201cAmerica\u2019s great right now.\u201d He later tweeted some supporting evidence that wasn\u2019t mentioned last night on CNN: U.S. businesses have added 13 million jobs over 66 straight months of employment growth, with the jobless rate dropping from 10% to 5%. The budget deficit has fallen from nearly 10% of GDP to less than 3% under Obama, while the uninsured rate has fallen from 15.4% to 9.2% under Obamacare. The U.S. auto industry, on the brink of extinction before Obama\u2019s bailout, is on pace for its best year since 2001.\n\nBut last night wasn\u2019t really about evidence, although several candidates did mention that wages are stagnant, and Bush noted the \u201clabor participation rate\u201d has been declining since 1977. There was a consensus on stage that illegal immigration is a national crisis\u2014an \u201cincredible problem,\u201d said Ben Carson\u2014even though the population of undocumented immigration has actually declined by about 1 million under Obama. Carson also bemoaned how little has been done to push oil independence; in fact, oil imports from the Middle East just hit a 28-year low. Listening to Graham, Rubio and Fiorina decrying the weakness of the military and the need for a much larger navy, a listener never would have guessed that the U.S. spends five times as much as any other country on defense.\n\nThere was some debate about the Iraq War, and Trump mentioned the financial cataclysm of 2008, but some of the candidates openly pined for the good old days of George W. Bush. It wasn\u2019t just Jeb who credited his brother with keeping the country safe; Christie added that Obama had stripped away that safety, even though the September 11 attacks were on Bush\u2019s watch, and nothing similar has happened since. Fiorina actually seemed to suggest the economy was better when Lehman Brothers was collapsing in September 2008, suggesting that \u201cin seven short years the president has stolen our belief that our children will have a better future.\u201d\n\nThe doom and gloom was especially intense around foreign affairs, with general agreement that, as Jeb Bush put it, \u201cthis administration has created insecurity the likes of which we never could have imagined.\u201d Rubio threw around words like \u201capocalyptic\u201d to describe the danger of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal. There were numerous references to the danger that ISIS poses to the American homeland. Trump asked why no one seemed to be worrying about the North Korean threat.\n\n\u201cThis world,\u201d he summed up, \u201cis a mess.\u201d\n\nIn this woe-a-thon, it was interesting to hear Kasich talk about his desire to give people \u201ca sense of hope, a sense of unity, a sense we can do it,\u201d he said. He sounded more genuinely Reaganesque than Bush, who talks about running a joyful campaign the way unhappy people often telling their friends how happy they are.\n\nBut for now, the Republican Party is Trump\u2019s party, and it was amusing to watch also-rans like Bobby Jindal try to play Trump on TV. Jindal described an America where illegal immigration is a national nightmare, where anti-Christian discrimination is a national epidemic, and the Republican Party\u2014which has failed to defund Planned Parenthood or block the Iran Deal\u2014is a national disgrace.\n\nOn that last point, at least, Obama probably agrees."], ["http://nypost.com/2014/06/27/hillary-called-obama-a-joke-at-lunch-with-pals-book/", "Hillary called Obama \u2018incompetent and feckless\u2019 in boozy rant", "Hillary Clinton called President Obama \u201cincompetent and feckless\u201d and charged that he had \u201cno hand on the tiller half the time\u201d during a boozy reunion with college pals, a new book claims.\n\nThe scathing attacks came as the wine was flowing at a May 2013 dinner at Le Jardin Du Roi, a cozy French bistro near the Clinton family home in Westchester, according to \u201cBlood Feud,\u201d by best-selling author Edward Klein.\n\nThe former first lady, months removed from being Obama\u2019s secretary of state, unleashed the verbal assault between sips of vino, sources told the author.\n\n\u201cWhen her friends asked Hillary to tell them what she thought \u2014 really thought \u2014 about the president she had served for four draining years, she lit into Obama with a passion that surprised them all,\u201d Klein wrote.\n\nClinton ranted, \u201cThe thing with Obama is that he can\u2019t be bothered, and there is no hand on the tiller half the time.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\""], ["http://www.ipi.org/ipi_issues/detail/what-the-veterans-administration-scandal-tells-us-about-obamacare", "What the Veterans Administration scandal tells us about Obamacare > IPI Issues > Institute for Policy Innovation", "What the Veterans Administration scandal tells us about Obamacare\n\nAmericans should be paying close attention to the emerging healthcare scandal in the Veterans Administration (VA), because it\u2019s a preview of what we will all be experiencing soon under Obamacare.\n\nVA health care has long been a blot on a country that historically has treated its veterans well (Vietnam excepted).

It was more like Darkness at Noon. Jeb Bush did call for the party to embrace a Reaganesque sense of optimism, which he contrasted with \u201cthe Donald Trump approach of \u2018Everything is bad, everything is coming to an end.\u201d But with occasional exceptions, usually involving the softer-edged John Kasich, the Trump approach dominated. For five hours, the candidates stood in front of Reagan\u2019s plane and described America as a declining nation in a dystopic world, as they pledged, to borrow a phrase, to Make America Great Again.\n\nThe big question of 2016 could well be whether Americans agree with the Republican portrait of Obama-era malaise. It was taken for granted last night that the national debt is out of control, the economy is deteriorating, the government is corrupt, and the world, as Lindsey Graham put it, is \u201con fire.\u201d Rubio complained that \u201cour left-wing government is undermining all the institutions that support the family.\u201d Ted Cruz declared that the Iran nuclear deal would turn the Obama administration into the world\u2019s largest financier of Islamic terror. Chris Christie said the middle class \u201cis getting plowed over by Barack Obama.\u201d The one thing the Republicans didn\u2019t seem too concerned about was climate change, which they agreed was not a problem worthy of solutions that might increase utility bills at a time when average Americans, as Rick Santorum put it, \u201care losing ground.\u201d\n\nObama provided an alternative view yesterday before the debate, making the case before the Business Roundtable that \u201cAmerica\u2019s great right now.\u201d He later tweeted some supporting evidence that wasn\u2019t mentioned last night on CNN: U.S. businesses have added 13 million jobs over 66 straight months of employment growth, with the jobless rate dropping from 10% to 5%. The budget deficit has fallen from nearly 10% of GDP to less than 3% under Obama, while the uninsured rate has fallen from 15.4% to 9.2% under Obamacare. The U.S. auto industry, on the brink of extinction before Obama\u2019s bailout, is on pace for its best year since 2001.\n\nBut last night wasn\u2019t really about evidence, although several candidates did mention that wages are stagnant, and Bush noted the \u201clabor participation rate\u201d has been declining since 1977. There was a consensus on stage that illegal immigration is a national crisis\u2014an \u201cincredible problem,\u201d said Ben Carson\u2014even though the population of undocumented immigration has actually declined by about 1 million under Obama. Carson also bemoaned how little has been done to push oil independence; in fact, oil imports from the Middle East just hit a 28-year low. Listening to Graham, Rubio and Fiorina decrying the weakness of the military and the need for a much larger navy, a listener never would have guessed that the U.S. spends five times as much as any other country on defense.\n\nThere was some debate about the Iraq War, and Trump mentioned the financial cataclysm of 2008, but some of the candidates openly pined for the good old days of George W. Bush. It wasn\u2019t just Jeb who credited his brother with keeping the country safe; Christie added that Obama had stripped away that safety, even though the September 11 attacks were on Bush\u2019s watch, and nothing similar has happened since. Fiorina actually seemed to suggest the economy was better when Lehman Brothers was collapsing in September 2008, suggesting that \u201cin seven short years the president has stolen our belief that our children will have a better future.\u201d\n\nThe doom and gloom was especially intense around foreign affairs, with general agreement that, as Jeb Bush put it, \u201cthis administration has created insecurity the likes of which we never could have imagined.\u201d Rubio threw around words like \u201capocalyptic\u201d to describe the danger of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal. There were numerous references to the danger that ISIS poses to the American homeland. Trump asked why no one seemed to be worrying about the North Korean threat.\n\n\u201cThis world,\u201d he summed up, \u201cis a mess.\u201d\n\nIn this woe-a-thon, it was interesting to hear Kasich talk about his desire to give people \u201ca sense of hope, a sense of unity, a sense we can do it,\u201d he said. He sounded more genuinely Reaganesque than Bush, who talks about running a joyful campaign the way unhappy people often telling their friends how happy they are.\n\nBut for now, the Republican Party is Trump\u2019s party, and it was amusing to watch also-rans like Bobby Jindal try to play Trump on TV. Jindal described an America where illegal immigration is a national nightmare, where anti-Christian discrimination is a national epidemic, and the Republican Party\u2014which has failed to defund Planned Parenthood or block the Iran Deal\u2014is a national disgrace.\n\nOn that last point, at least, Obama probably agrees."], ["http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/a-look-at-modi-governments-ministers-who-are-media-shy-and-work-from-the-shadows/articleshow/49020413.cms", "A look at Modi government's ministers who are media shy and work from the shadows", "NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have earned the reputation of not being able to resist the camera or a microphone thrust at him for a quick byte but some of his ministerial colleagues strike a complete contrast as they shun the limelight and appear to be working in the shadows since they took office more than a year ago.Among the Cabinet ministers who have avoided the media glare, Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram takes the cake.

A growing world demand for fish \u2014 partly driven by fishing subsidies estimated at up to $35 billion per year \u2014 is depleting many coastal fisheries and causing fishing fleets to look further into deeper waters. The declining stocks of bluefin and yellowfin are of particular concern, as populations of adult Pacific bluefin were estimated to be as low as 40,000 individuals last year.\n\nLouise Heaps, Chief Adviser on Marine Policy at WWF-UK, said in the original press release that \u201cby over-exploiting fisheries, degrading coastal habitats and not addressing global warming, we are sowing the seeds of ecological and economic catastrophe.\u201d\n\nClimate change is causing the ocean to change more rapidly than at any other point in millions of years, according to WWF. Rising temperatures and increased acidity levels caused by carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere further weaken ocean systems and degrade habitats, like coral reefs and mangroves.\n\nThe study predicted the possibility of losing all coral reefs by 2050 due to warming oceans and ocean acidification. This is not only a huge danger to a quarter of all marine species that live in coral reefs, but also to the communities that rely on reefs for economic and social benefits.

Paul Gosar (R-AZ) wrote a letter in Town Hall this week outlining why he\u2019s skipping out on the pope\u2019s visit to Congress. The main reason? Climate change.\n\n\u201cMedia reports indicate His Holiness instead intends to focus the brunt of his speech on climate change \u2014 a climate that has been changing since first created in Genesis,\u201d Gosar writes. \u201cMore troubling is the fact that this climate change talk has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into \u201cclimate justice\u201d and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies.\u201d\n\nGosar, who states in the letter that he\u2019s \u201ca proud Catholic,\u201d goes on to say that he\u2019d gladly attend the pope\u2019s speech if he had chosen instead to focus on issues like religious liberty and the need to combat ISIS.\n\n\u201cIf the Pope stuck to standard Christian theology, I would be the first in line. If the Pope spoke out with moral authority against violent Islam, I would be there cheering him on. If the Pope urged the Western nations to rescue persecuted Christians in the Middle East, I would back him wholeheartedly,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut when the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Pope Francis is expected to address climate change during his visit to Washington, D.C. and New York City. The pope has made climate change and environmental issues a central part of his papacy \u2014 in his environmental encyclical, released in June, Pope Francis laid out the scientific evidence for human-caused climate change and spoke of the necessity to develop meaningful environmental policy.\n\nBut Gosar\u2019s stance on climate change is out of line with the pope\u2019s. In 2012 Gosar said climate change \u201cis likely not in our control in any event. Historical records clearly demonstrate vast temperature swings long before Man arrived, from temperate zones in Alaska to ice ages in New York.\u201d In his letter this week, Gosar expounded reiterated his views on climate change.\n\n\u201cThe earth\u2019s climate has been changing since God created it, with or without man. On that, we should all agree,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBut the pope\u2019s calls for action on climate change are more in line with Catholicism than Gosar thinks. Pope Francis isn\u2019t the first head of the Catholic church to connect environmentalism with theology: Pope Paul VI wrote in 1972 that \u201cman and his environment are more inseparable than ever,\u201d and Pope John Paul II, in his 1990 World Day of Peace statement, warned that the planet is threatened by \u201ca lack of due respect for nature, by the plundering of natural resources and by a progressive decline in the quality of life.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s not yet known what exactly Pope Francis will say during his trip to Washington and New York, he\u2019s expected to discuss climate change and immigration issues.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet whether other lawmakers who don\u2019t agree with the pope\u2019s stance on climate change will also skip out on his Congressional address. But in contrast to Gosar\u2019s decision to boycott, some Republican lawmakers have actually used the pope\u2019s visit to call attention to climate change. Rep. Chris Gibson (R-NY) sponsored a resolution, released Thursday, that called for action on climate change.\n\n\u201cIf left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have the potential to adversely impact all Americans, hitting vulnerable populations hardest, harming productivity in key economic sectors such as construction, agriculture, and tourism, saddling future generations with costly economic and environmental burdens, and imposing additional costs on State and Federal budgets that will further add to the long-term fiscal challenges that we face as a nation,\u201d the resolution, which was co-signed by 10 other Republicans, states."], ["http://act.credoaction.com/sign/wildfire_funding?sp_ref=150171948.4.15932.t.66101.2&referring_akid=.8396946.3BND17&source=tw_sp", "Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act... and make polluters pay for it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse.

Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important.

These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Many people have probably heard about Nicole Arbour\u2019s fat-shaming rant on YouTube, and more notably, how quickly fat positive activists like Whitney Way Thore and Lindy West responded, calling out its cruelty, lack of actual comedic quality, unoriginality, and outdatedness. The latter critique, the one that suggest we\u2019ve moved beyond fat shaming in such blatant and overt ways, is mentioned and supported by West, who nods to a body-positivity movement that has been increasingly acknowledged by the mainstream. And I would have to agree, the fat/body-positive movement is bustling\u2026 with white women.\n\nThe legacy of fat/body-positivity is turning out to be not much different than the history of the feminist movement that it relies on to support its stances: one that prioritizes and privileges white women. Representations of fat white women have become commercially accessible and visible \u2013 for example reality shows to reveal the complexities of their lives and magazine covers intended to convince women that they can indeed be fat and confident. Meanwhile, fat Black women\u2019s representation in mass media is relegated to comedy (where our bodies become part of the act itself); and we all hold our breaths, waiting for the latest Precious joke to pass while simultaneously praying that Gabby Sidibe\u2018s current major role won\u2019t be her last. And while trendy fashion bloggers like Gabi Fresh and Essie Golden are certainly beginning to push the boundaries on fat Black girl visibility in a way that isn\u2019t strictly satirical/degrading, they are limited to the beauty subgenre (because for us the presentation must always be on point). Meanwhile, Rebel Wilson graced the cover of ELLE.\n\nhttp://mckpasta.com/post/119409095251/pay-attention-to-how-rebel-wilson-is-received\n\nWhen Tess Holliday\u2013considered by some to be the first plus-sized supermodel, and arguably one of the most visible figures in the movement to promote body acceptance\u2013proudly touted that Black men \u201clove\u201d her, she indirectly supported an assumption that most fat Black girls know not to be true: that Black communities treat fat women better than other communities do. We are in a body-positivity era that is ignoring women of color and Black women and doing so by resting on the false notion that for Black girls and women, being fat is somehow easier. In what feels like an asinine case of \u201creverse\u201d psychology, body-positive white woman are subtly suggesting that not having to deal with fat shaming is a privilege that only Black women are afforded. Per usual, people are reaching for their piece of the oppression pie (pun intended).\n\nIt is oft cited and mentioned that studies show that Black women have higher self-esteem and body image. However, high self esteem does not equal less fat-shaming, fatphobia, or other violence against fat Black women. For one, even if it were true that Black communities were more accepting of their fat women (which it isn\u2019t), Black women don\u2019t live in a cultural vacuum where they only engage and are affected by other Black people! Remember when that fat, Black woman went to yoga to mind her own damn business and then became the porous object to absorb all of Jen Carson\u2019s white guilt? That\u2019s a perfect example of how Blackness can\u2019t save us from fatphobia (and certainly not white tears). And even within our communities fatphobia can wreck havoc on the lives of fat Black women. Just this past weekend I was at a music festival where I met one of my favorite cast members (a Black woman) from reality show \u201cLove & Hip Hop Atlanta.\u201d All was going well and I was thrilled at how kind and down to earth she was until she told me that I was too cute to be too fat. A few years ago, when word got out that I was sexually assaulted (by a Black man), people in the neighborhood where it occurred doubted that it could have happened because I\u2019m so big that there\u2019s no way I couldn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t have fought back to avoid the attack.\n\nSo please, let\u2019s stop go ahead and set the record straight that Blackness is not the neutralizer of fatness. We need to get comfortable with and accept that Black women are also facing fat discrimination, are also participating in body acceptance movements, and also deserve to be represented."], ["http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/09/18/3703006/gosar-boycott-pope-francis/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "Catholic Congressman Will Skip Papal Address To Congress, Cites Climate Change", "Climate Catholic Congressman Will Skip Papal Address To Congress, Cites Climate Change CREDIT: AP Photo/Matt York, File\n\nWhen Pope Francis addresses Congress in Washington, D.C. next week, at least one Republican representative won\u2019t be in the audience.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) wrote a letter in Town Hall this week outlining why he\u2019s skipping out on the pope\u2019s visit to Congress. The main reason? Climate change.\n\n\u201cMedia reports indicate His Holiness instead intends to focus the brunt of his speech on climate change \u2014 a climate that has been changing since first created in Genesis,\u201d Gosar writes. \u201cMore troubling is the fact that this climate change talk has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into \u201cclimate justice\u201d and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies.\u201d\n\nGosar, who states in the letter that he\u2019s \u201ca proud Catholic,\u201d goes on to say that he\u2019d gladly attend the pope\u2019s speech if he had chosen instead to focus on issues like religious liberty and the need to combat ISIS.\n\n\u201cIf the Pope stuck to standard Christian theology, I would be the first in line. If the Pope spoke out with moral authority against violent Islam, I would be there cheering him on. If the Pope urged the Western nations to rescue persecuted Christians in the Middle East, I would back him wholeheartedly,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut when the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Pope Francis is expected to address climate change during his visit to Washington, D.C. and New York City. The pope has made climate change and environmental issues a central part of his papacy \u2014 in his environmental encyclical, released in June, Pope Francis laid out the scientific evidence for human-caused climate change and spoke of the necessity to develop meaningful environmental policy.\n\nBut Gosar\u2019s stance on climate change is out of line with the pope\u2019s. In 2012 Gosar said climate change \u201cis likely not in our control in any event. Historical records clearly demonstrate vast temperature swings long before Man arrived, from temperate zones in Alaska to ice ages in New York.\u201d In his letter this week, Gosar expounded reiterated his views on climate change.\n\n\u201cThe earth\u2019s climate has been changing since God created it, with or without man. On that, we should all agree,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBut the pope\u2019s calls for action on climate change are more in line with Catholicism than Gosar thinks. Pope Francis isn\u2019t the first head of the Catholic church to connect environmentalism with theology: Pope Paul VI wrote in 1972 that \u201cman and his environment are more inseparable than ever,\u201d and Pope John Paul II, in his 1990 World Day of Peace statement, warned that the planet is threatened by \u201ca lack of due respect for nature, by the plundering of natural resources and by a progressive decline in the quality of life.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s not yet known what exactly Pope Francis will say during his trip to Washington and New York, he\u2019s expected to discuss climate change and immigration issues.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet whether other lawmakers who don\u2019t agree with the pope\u2019s stance on climate change will also skip out on his Congressional address. But in contrast to Gosar\u2019s decision to boycott, some Republican lawmakers have actually used the pope\u2019s visit to call attention to climate change. Rep. Chris Gibson (R-NY) sponsored a resolution, released Thursday, that called for action on climate change.\n\n\u201cIf left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have the potential to adversely impact all Americans, hitting vulnerable populations hardest, harming productivity in key economic sectors such as construction, agriculture, and tourism, saddling future generations with costly economic and environmental burdens, and imposing additional costs on State and Federal budgets that will further add to the long-term fiscal challenges that we face as a nation,\u201d the resolution, which was co-signed by 10 other Republicans, states."], ["http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/09/18/3702590/ocean-collapsing-worse-thought/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "Climate Change And Overfishing Are Driving The World's Oceans To The 'Brink Of Collapse'", "Climate Climate Change And Overfishing Are Driving The World\u2019s Oceans To The \u2018Brink Of Collapse\u2019 CREDIT: DYLAN PETROHILOS/THINKPROGRESS\n\nWithin a single generation, human activity has severely damaged almost every aspect of our global oceans.\n\nThat\u2019s the finding of a new World Wildlife Fund study, which revealed that marine populations have declined 49 percent between 1970 and 2012.

These range from the rather small \u2014 Nashua, N.H. received $583,000 that year. To the rather large \u2014 New York City received $210.9 million of the grants.\n\nNow, under the new rule, HUD will empower itself to nationalize local zoning decisions in every single one of these localities in an attempt to create evenly distributed neighborhoods based on racial composition and income.\n\n\u201cThis is a utopian pipe dream, and social engineering at its worst,\u201d Americans for Limited Government President Nathan Mehrens said.\n\n\u201cNeighborhoods are constituted not based on racial quotas, but on economics,\u201d he added.\n\nMehrens called on the House of Representatives to defund implementation of the rule via a rider to the Transportation and HUD appropriations bill coming up next week.\n\nA trial run for the rule has already occurred in Westchester County, N.Y., where the department has attempted for years to rezone the area as a condition for receiving millions in grants.\n\nCounty Executive Rob Astorino, a Republican, told HUD to go pound sand, and simply rejected the receipt of $5 million of grants from 2012.\n\nWestchester lost out on some $7 million of grants from 2011 for the same reason.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that HUD, which claims to champion the needy, once again is threatening to withhold funds for affordable housing,\u201d said Astorino spokesman Ned McCormack in April. \u201cBut the county is not going to turn over control of the local zoning of its six cities, 19 towns and 20 villages to bureaucrats in Washington for $5 million in grants.\u201d\n\nHUD was demanding that the county build 750 units of affordable housing in 31 more affluent communities.\n\nNow, Astorino, running for governor this year against Andrew Cuomo, is challenging in federal court the legal basis under which HUD can even condition the grants in exchange for changes to zoning.\n\nNow, call me a cynic, but this probably has nothing at all to do with integrating communities on the basis of race or income. More likely, this is a pretext to tilt the political scales on the national and local political scenes for the next generation to favor Democrats.\n\nIt is no secret that Republicans with their low tax message tend to do better among the middle and upper middle classes, while Democrats with their social welfare regime tend to do better among the poor.\n\nThe solution for Democrats? Via regulation, force communities dependent on federal funding to build more homes and apartments where Democrats are likely to live.\n\nIf for no other reason, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives should defund the new rulemaking, which represents an existential threat to its continued viability as a national political party.\n\nBut, leaving that aside, it\u2019s also completely insane from a policy standpoint. Forcing wealthier communities to build so-called affordable housing units could depress property values, increase local taxes, and place a greater strain on public services.\n\nIt also violates the constitutional balance of powers between the federal, state, and local governments. The federal government has zero role, constitutionally, in local zoning decisions. That is a matter for county and municipal boards.\n\nBesides, it will not do a thing to alleviate actual housing discrimination, ALG\u2019s Mehrens noted, \u201cHousing discrimination based on race has been illegal for decades. There is no discrimination in people choosing for themselves where they want to live, and yet that is exactly what HUD is seeking to regulate.\u201d\n\nRobert Romano is the senior editor of Americans for Limited Government."], ["http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/09/18/1422588/-Texas-police-caught-in-an-enormous-lie-about-their-murder-of-an-unarmed-mother-Yvette-Smith", "Texas police caught in an enormous lie about their murder of unarmed mother Yvette Smith", "Below, see the initial statement from Sheriff Terry Pickering, issued just hours after Smith died.\n\nWhen Smith opened the front door of her home, she was shot twice with a high-powered .223 caliber rifle in less than two seconds by Officer Daniel Willis of Bastrop County, Texas, outside of Austin.\n\nFirst off, Smith called 911 for help because two men in her home were arguing over a financial dispute and she felt it was getting out of hand. She had nothing to do with the dispute and was an innocent bystander\u2014a victim, even. When the police showed up, both men were already in the front yard and it appeared that the dispute was settled. This should've been case closed, but it wasn't.\n\nOn February 16, 2014, Yvette Smith, a 47-year-old mother beloved by her family and community, was shot twice by an AR-15 assault rifle and killed on the spot by local police as she opened the front door of her home. A full 18 months later, as her case finally came before a jury, it's disturbingly clear that the police lied, repeatedly, in an attempt to cover up their murder of Smith.\n\nYvette Smith Shooting - First Police Statement by hsiehnation\n\nAs you may have seen, police not only claimed that Smith emerged from the home with a firearm, they stated that she ignored police commands. In essence, Smith came out of that house, according to police, ready to bring hellfire and damnation on police and they acted out in self-defense from an incredibly dangerous woman.\n\nThis is a lie. A complete fabrication. When Sheriff Terry Pickering issued the statement, he was fully and completely aware that Yvette Smith wasn't armed. No weapon was found on or near her. He knew this. The officers on the scene knew this, but Sheriff Pickering issued that statement anyway. It sounded better.\n\nKnowing that the evidence and scores of eyewitnesses saw that she was unarmed, police later retracted the statement, but have given absolutely no answers or held anyone responsible for the earlier lie\u2014which was the primary reason given for shooting Smith in the first place.\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but the lies get worse\u2014much worse.\n\nAs you saw in the initial statement released by police, they claimed that Smith ignored their commands. On September 17, in open court, we learned that this was also an elaborate lie told to justify police misconduct.\n\n\n\nDeputy Scott Gaskamp, who arrived at the scene just moments before the shooting, had told investigators and written reports stating that they had ordered Smith to show them her hands, to open the door and come out of the house, Gaskamp testified Thursday. Recordings of the incident showed no commands were ever issued.\n\nGaskamp told the court he never amended any of his reports or came forward to investigators to correct his errors. After reviewing the dashboard camera footage caught from his patrol vehicle and Willis\u2019 vehicle, he realized his written reports were wrong and that he had never told Smith to put her hands up or issued any other command. \u201cI did not say those words. It must have been a figment of my imagination,\u201d Gaskamp said.\n\nWhen pressed to explain this in court, Officer Gaskamp literally admitted that he made the whole damn thing up. He also stated that he couldn't remember telling this lie to the lead investigator, until they played him the recorded interview where he stated the lie over and over again.Are you tracking this? Let me summarize it for you . . .\n\nYvette Smith called 911 for help.\n\nShe opened the front door of her home and was almost instantly shot twice by police with an AR-15 assault rifle.\n\nThe officers on the scene lied and said she was armed.\n\nThe supervising officer doubled down on the lie and spread it in a press release.\n\nThe officers then lied and said they made multiple commands that Smith ignored, but the dashcam footage shows that none of those commands were made. Not one of them.\n\nThe coverup continued . . .\n\n\n\nA few weeks after the shooting, an investigation by BCSO revealed that several supervisors had modified Willis\u2019 field training records after the shooting in an effort to make sure the records were completed accurately. A lieutenant and a sergeant were demoted to patrol deputy and five additional supervisors also faced disciplinary action because of the record changes.\n\nBefore working for Bastrop County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Willis, 29, was employed by Travis County. A Travis County 2012 evaluation of Willis stated that Willis needed more development in handling explosive situations and in the utilization of common sense.\n\nLastly, and this may be the most disturbing fact of all, it was discovered that the officer who shot and killed Smith was found incompetent by another police department.Yes, you read that correctly: The damn evaluation said the police officer who killed Yvette Smith struggled with \"common sense,\" but was hired by a neighboring department anyway.\n\nWhile Officer Willis has been charged in Smith's death, it is increasingly clear that the entire Bastrop County Sheriff's Office conspired to protect one another and cover up this crime. All of them should be immediately fired and a statewide investigation needs to be launched into the corrupt actions that we can clearly see in the murder of Yvette Smith.\n\n"], ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240010/Number-refugees-arriving-Europe-soars-85-year-just-one-five-war-torn-Syria.html", "Four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria: EU figures expose the 'lie'", "Four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria: EU figures expose the 'lie' that the majority of refugees are fleeing war zone\n\nSome 44,000 of the 213,000 refugees who arrived in Europe were from Syria\n\nA further 27,000 new arrivals on the continent came from Afghanistan\n\nBritain received one in 30 of all the asylum claims made by new applicants\n\nDavid Cameron has offered to take in 20,000 refugees but none from the EU\n\nOnly one in every five migrants claiming asylum in Europe is from Syria.\n\nThe EU logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war.\n\nCampaigners and left-wing MPs have suggested the vast majority of migrants are from the war-torn state, accusing the Government of doing too little to help them.\n\n'This exposes the lie peddled in some quarters that vast numbers of those reaching Europe are from Syria,' said David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth.

But new Eurostat figures show the truth: 80 per cent are economic migrants from as far afield as Pakistan, Nigeria and Albania simply looking for a better life. The Mail does not underestimate the agony and desperation of genuine Syrian asylum seekers who, of course, deserve care and compassion. That\u2019s why David Cameron was right to ensure that those granted refuge in Britain come from camps on the Syrian border, rather than from among those already in Europe \u2013 who may not be Syrian. But Germany \u2013 by first extending a welcome to all migrants, then slamming its borders shut when overwhelming numbers responded to the invitation \u2013 has created chaos for all its neighbours, where untold numbers are now stranded. Through her naive and muddled policy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has placed the very future of the EU in jeopardy.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel fuelled the chaos last month by declaring that any Syrian who reached the country could claim asylum.\n\nWhen the numbers became uncontrollable Berlin shut its borders, throwing Austria, Hungary and other EU countries into turmoil.\n\nCroatia has received 14,000 migrants in the past two days and was last night moving some to the Hungarian border.\n\nHungary is laying razor wire on the border having done the same on its border with Serbia.\n\nCroatia has closed seven of eight road crossings to Serbia and ordered its border guards to redirect migrants to Hungary and Slovenia. The Hungarian government described this as 'totally unacceptable'.\n\nViolence broke out yesterday between Syrian and Afghan migrants fighting to board trains across Croatia.\n\nAnd Slovenian riot police last night stood in the path of 200 migrants trying to enter from Croatia. Slovenian ministers say they will accept asylum seekers but send back anyone deemed to be an illegal immigrant.\n\nBritain, which received 7,470 asylum applications between April and June, has come under fire for failing to join an EU scheme to spread 160,000 migrants between the 28 member states.\n\nA man uses crutches as he joins other migrants crossing the border between Greece and Macedonia near the city of Gevgelija, Macedonia\n\nRefugees sit under a bridge at the border between Austria and Germany, in Freilassing, southern Germany this morning\n\nGERMANY COULD SPEND UP TO \u20ac25 BILLION ON MIGRANT INTAKE Germany's lead in housing hundreds of thousands of migrants heading to Europe from a war-torn Middle East could cost its Treasury tens of billions of euros over the next two years, according to early private estimates. The Japanese investment bank Mizuho was one of the first to put a number on it on yesterday, saying that accepting up to one million refugees a year over the next two years could cost Berlin \u20ac25 billion euros. That is derived from a basic calculation of \u20ac12,500 per migrant, according to Peter Chatwell, senior rates strategist at Mizuho. Part of the extra spending may have to be met by extra borrowing. Over half a dozen banks contacted by Reuters broadly agreed with Mizuho's calculations.\n\nDavid Cameron has announced the UK will shelter 20,000 vulnerable Syrians from camps in Lebanon and Jordan. But he rejected calls to take migrants already in Europe, saying this would encourage more to make the dangerous journey.\n\nYvette Cooper, who chairs Labour's refugee taskforce, said: 'Britain's approach of only planning to take refugees from the camps in Syria isn't working.\n\n'It ignores the crisis also happening in Europe itself and means Britain has no leverage to get other countries to sign up to help.'\n\nBut a Home Office spokesman said: 'Claiming asylum must not be viewed as an easy means of settlement by those who are not actually refugees.\n\n'We need systems which keep out unfounded claims so we can all respond more quickly and effectively to those genuinely in need of refuge."], ["http://aattp.org/rand-paul-undergraduate-degree-lied/", "Surprise, Surprise!

She had nothing to do with the dispute and was an innocent bystander\u2014a victim, even. When the police showed up, both men were already in the front yard and it appeared that the dispute was settled. This should've been case closed, but it wasn't.\n\nOn February 16, 2014, Yvette Smith, a 47-year-old mother beloved by her family and community, was shot twice by an AR-15 assault rifle and killed on the spot by local police as she opened the front door of her home. A full 18 months later, as her case finally came before a jury, it's disturbingly clear that the police lied, repeatedly, in an attempt to cover up their murder of Smith.\n\nYvette Smith Shooting - First Police Statement by hsiehnation\n\nAs you may have seen, police not only claimed that Smith emerged from the home with a firearm, they stated that she ignored police commands. In essence, Smith came out of that house, according to police, ready to bring hellfire and damnation on police and they acted out in self-defense from an incredibly dangerous woman.\n\nThis is a lie. A complete fabrication. When Sheriff Terry Pickering issued the statement, he was fully and completely aware that Yvette Smith wasn't armed. No weapon was found on or near her. He knew this. The officers on the scene knew this, but Sheriff Pickering issued that statement anyway. It sounded better.\n\nKnowing that the evidence and scores of eyewitnesses saw that she was unarmed, police later retracted the statement, but have given absolutely no answers or held anyone responsible for the earlier lie\u2014which was the primary reason given for shooting Smith in the first place.\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but the lies get worse\u2014much worse.\n\nAs you saw in the initial statement released by police, they claimed that Smith ignored their commands. On September 17, in open court, we learned that this was also an elaborate lie told to justify police misconduct.\n\n\n\nDeputy Scott Gaskamp, who arrived at the scene just moments before the shooting, had told investigators and written reports stating that they had ordered Smith to show them her hands, to open the door and come out of the house, Gaskamp testified Thursday. Recordings of the incident showed no commands were ever issued.\n\nGaskamp told the court he never amended any of his reports or came forward to investigators to correct his errors. After reviewing the dashboard camera footage caught from his patrol vehicle and Willis\u2019 vehicle, he realized his written reports were wrong and that he had never told Smith to put her hands up or issued any other command. \u201cI did not say those words. It must have been a figment of my imagination,\u201d Gaskamp said.\n\nWhen pressed to explain this in court, Officer Gaskamp literally admitted that he made the whole damn thing up. He also stated that he couldn't remember telling this lie to the lead investigator, until they played him the recorded interview where he stated the lie over and over again.Are you tracking this? Let me summarize it for you . . .\n\nYvette Smith called 911 for help.\n\nShe opened the front door of her home and was almost instantly shot twice by police with an AR-15 assault rifle.\n\nThe officers on the scene lied and said she was armed.\n\nThe supervising officer doubled down on the lie and spread it in a press release.\n\nThe officers then lied and said they made multiple commands that Smith ignored, but the dashcam footage shows that none of those commands were made. Not one of them.\n\nThe coverup continued . . .\n\n\n\nA few weeks after the shooting, an investigation by BCSO revealed that several supervisors had modified Willis\u2019 field training records after the shooting in an effort to make sure the records were completed accurately. A lieutenant and a sergeant were demoted to patrol deputy and five additional supervisors also faced disciplinary action because of the record changes.\n\nBefore working for Bastrop County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Willis, 29, was employed by Travis County. A Travis County 2012 evaluation of Willis stated that Willis needed more development in handling explosive situations and in the utilization of common sense.\n\nLastly, and this may be the most disturbing fact of all, it was discovered that the officer who shot and killed Smith was found incompetent by another police department.Yes, you read that correctly: The damn evaluation said the police officer who killed Yvette Smith struggled with \"common sense,\" but was hired by a neighboring department anyway.\n\nWhile Officer Willis has been charged in Smith's death, it is increasingly clear that the entire Bastrop County Sheriff's Office conspired to protect one another and cover up this crime. All of them should be immediately fired and a statewide investigation needs to be launched into the corrupt actions that we can clearly see in the murder of Yvette Smith.\n\n"], ["http://aattp.org/rand-paul-undergraduate-degree-lied/", "Surprise, Surprise!

President Barack Obama\u2019s team negotiated the deal along with other countries of the P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and Germany). The Republicans in the U.S. Congress had threatened to pass a resolution that would block Obama\u2019s signature on such a deal. Obama had said he would veto any Bill that constrained his hand to sign that deal. He needed 34 Senators to back him in order to secure his veto. When Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland said she would support the President, the deal was safe.\n\nPhyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C., told me that Barbara Mikulski\u2019s vote was \u201ca big relief\u201d. She said that the Iran deal was \u201ca huge victory for diplomacy over the real threat of war with Iran\u201d. Trita Parsi and Reza Marashi of the National Iranian American Council agreed. Obama, they said, \u201chas proven to the U.S. that security is better achieved through diplomacy than through militarism\u201d. Emad Kiyaei of the American Iranian Council told me just after Barbara Mikulski\u2019s announcement: \u201cThere is no \u2018better\u2019 deal and the opposition has not introduced a viable alternative, except more coercive policies that to date have not slowed\u2014rather accelerated\u2014Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\u201d\n\nIn late August, Obama suggested that those who agreed with him were \u201cthe crazies\u201d. This suggested the strong push the White House had made to get the deal through. No wonder that the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Danielle Pletka told me that Obama was more belligerent with the Congress than the Iranian negotiators. \u201cI only wish the President had brought the same tenacity and purpose to the Iran talks,\u201d she told me, \u201cthan he brought to bludgeoning the representatives of the American people.\u201d\n\nTo get the wider context of the Iranian deal, I spoke to Professor Noam Chomsky, who laid out the geopolitical and historical context for this important agreement. \u2014 Vijay Prashad\n\nProfessor Chomsky, how would you characterise the Republican Party\u2019s reaction to the Iran nuclear deal?\n\nThe Republicans are almost unanimously opposed to the nuclear deal. The current Republican primaries illustrate the proclaimed reasons. Ted Cruz, considered one of the intellectuals of the group, warned that Iran may still be able to produce nuclear weapons, and it could use one to set off an electromagnetic pulse that \u201cwould take down the electrical grid of the entire eastern seaboard\u201d of the U.S., killing \u201ctens of millions of Americans\u201d. The two most likely winners of the primary, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, are battling over whether to bomb Iran immediately after being elected or after the first Cabinet meeting. The one candidate with some foreign policy experience, Lindsey Graham, described the deal as \u201ca death sentence for the State of Israel,\u201d which came as a surprise to Israeli intelligence and strategic analysts\u2014and which Graham too knows to be utter nonsense, raising immediate questions about actual motives.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that the Republicans have long abandoned the pretence of functioning as a normal parliamentary party. Rather, they have become a \u201cradical insurgency\u201d that scarcely seeks to participate in normal parliamentary politics, as observed by the respected conservative political commentator Norman Ornstein of the right-wing American Enterprise Institute. Since Ronald Reagan, the leadership has plunged so far into the pockets of the very rich and the corporate sector that they can attract votes only by mobilising sectors of the population that have not previously been an organised political force, among them extremist evangelical Christians, now probably the majority of Republican voters; remnants of the former slave-holding States; nativists who are terrified that \u201cthey\u201d are taking our white Christian Anglo-Saxon country away from us; and others who turn the Republican primaries into spectacles remote from the mainstream of modern society\u2014though not the mainstream of the most powerful country in world history.\n\nThe Republican suspicion of Iran seems to be shared across sections of the political spectrum, even among those who are for the deal. Could you address that suspicion of Iran?\n\nAcross the spectrum, there is general agreement with the \u201cpragmatic\u201d conclusion of General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the Vienna deal \u201cdid not prevent the U.S. from striking Iranian facilities if officials decide that it is cheating on the agreement\u201d, even though a unilateral military strike is \u201cfar less likely\u201d if Iran behaves. Former Clinton and Obama Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross recommends that \u201cIran must have no doubt that if we see it moving towards a weapon, that would trigger the use of force\u201d even after the termination of the deal, when Iran is free to do what it wants. In fact, the existence of a termination point 15 years hence is \u201cthe greatest single problem with the agreement,\u201d he adds, recommending that the U.S. provide Israel with B-52 bombers to protect itself before that terrifying date arrives.\n\nThe underlying assumption here is that Iran is a serious threat, that it would attack Israel with nuclear weapons. How credible is that threat?\n\nTo be sure, Israel faces the \u201cexistential threat\u201d of Iranian pronouncements: Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad famously threatened it with destruction. Except that they didn\u2019t\u2014and if they had, it would be of little moment. They predicted that \u201cUnder God\u2019s grace [the Zionist regime] will be wiped off the map.\u201d Another translation suggests that Ahmadinejad actually said that Israel \u201cmust vanish from the page of time\u201d. This is a citation of a statement made by Ayatollah Khomeini, during a period when Iran and Israel were tacitly allied. In other words, they hope that regime change will someday take place. They do not say that they will attack Israel either now or later.\n\nAhmadinejad\u2019s threats fall far short of regular U.S.-Israeli direct calls for regime change in Iran, not to speak of actions to implement regime change going back to the actual \u201cregime change\u201d of 1953, when the U.S. organised a military coup to overthrow the Iranian parliamentary regime and install the dictatorship of the Shah, who proceeded with one of the world\u2019s worst human rights records. These crimes were known to readers of Amnesty International and other human rights organisations, but not to readers of the U.S. press, which has indeed devoted plenty of space to Iranian human rights violations, but only after 1979, when the U.S.-imposed regime was overthrown. The instructive facts are documented carefully in a study by Mansour Farhang and William Dorman.\n\nNone of this is a departure from the norm. The U.S., as is well known, holds the world championship in regime change, and Israel is no laggard either. The most destructive of Israel\u2019s invasions of Lebanon, in 1982, was explicitly aimed at regime change, along with securing its hold on the Occupied Territories. The pretexts offered were very thin, and collapsed at once. That too is not unusual and pretty much independent of the nature of the society, from the laments in the Declaration of Independence about the \u201cmerciless Indian savages\u201d to Hitler\u2019s defence of Germany from the \u201cwild terror\u201d of the Poles.\n\nNo serious analyst believes that Iran would ever use, or even threaten to use, a nuclear weapon if it had one, thus facing instant destruction. There is, however, real concern that a nuclear weapon might fall into jehadi hands\u2014not from Iran, where the threat is minuscule, but from the U.S. ally Pakistan, where it is very real.\n\nIn the journal of the (British) Royal Institute of International Affairs, two leading Pakistani nuclear scientists, Pervez Hoodbhoy and Zia Mian, write that increasing fears of \u201cmilitants seizing nuclear weapons or materials and unleashing nuclear terrorism [have led to] the creation of a dedicated force of over 20,000 troops to guard nuclear facilities [though] there is no reason to assume, however, that this force would be immune to the problems associated with the units guarding regular military facilities,\u201d which have frequently suffered attacks with \u201cinsider help\u201d. In brief, the problem is real, but is displaced by fantasies concocted for other reasons.\n\nProfessor Chomsky, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, has said that the problem is the \u201cinstability that Iran fuels beyond its nuclear programme\u201d. She echoed U.S. Defence Secretary Ashton Carter, who went to Israel\u2019s northern border and said, \u201cWe will continue to help Israel counter Iran\u2019s malign influence\u201d by supporting Hizbollah. The U.S., he intimated, reserved the right to use military force against Iran. Could you comment on this?\n\nPower\u2019s usage is standard: she defines \u201cstabilisation\u201d according to a peculiar logic. For instance, U.S. policy in Iraq is defined as stabilisation. What does that stabilisation look like? The U.S. invades a country, with hundreds of thousands killed and millions becoming refugees, along with barbarous torture and destruction that Iraqis compare to the Mongol invasions, leaving Iraq the unhappiest country in the world according to WIN/Gallup polls. It also ignited sectarian conflict that is tearing the region to shreds and laying the basis for the ISIS [Islamic State of Iraq and Syria] monstrosity along with its Saudi ally. That is stabilisation. The standard usage sometimes reaches levels that are almost surreal, as when liberal commentator James Chace, former editor of Foreign Affairs, explains that the U.S. sought to \u201cdestabilise a freely elected Marxist government in Chile\u201d because \u201cwe were determined to seek stability\u201d [under the Pinochet dictatorship].\n\nLet us consider the case of Hizbollah and Hamas. Both emerged in resistance to U.S.-backed Israeli violence and aggression, which vastly exceeds anything attributed to these organisations. Whatever one thinks about them, or other beneficiaries of Iranian support, Iran hardly ranks high in support for terror worldwide, even within the Muslim world. Among Islamic states, Saudi Arabia is far in the lead as a sponsor of Islamic terror, not only by direct funding by wealthy Saudis and others in the Gulf but even more by the missionary zeal with which the Saudis promulgate their extremist Wahhabi-Salafi version of Islam through Quranic schools, mosques, clerics, and other means available to a religious dictatorship with enormous oil wealth. The ISIS is an extremist offshoot of Saudi religious extremism and its fanning of jehadi flames.\n\nIn generation of Islamic terror, however, nothing can compare with the U.S. \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which has helped to spread the plague from a small tribal area in Afghanistan-Pakistan to a vast region from West Africa to South-East Asia. The invasion of Iraq alone escalated terror attacks by a factor of seven in the first year, well beyond even what had been predicted by intelligence agencies. Drone warfare against marginalised and oppressed tribal societies also elicits demands for revenge, as ample evidence indicates.\n\nThe two Iranian clients [Hizbollah and Hamas] also share the crime of winning the popular vote in the only free elections held in the Arab world. Hizbollah is guilty of the even more heinous crime of compelling Israel to withdraw from its occupation of southern Lebanon in violation of [U.N.] Security Council orders dating back decades, an illegal regime of terror punctuated with episodes of extreme violence, murder and destruction.\n\nIran\u2019s \u201cfuelling instability\u201d is particularly dramatic in Iraq, where, among other crimes, it alone came at once to the aid of Kurds defending themselves from the ISIS invasion and it is building a $2.5 billion power plant to try to bring electrical power back to the level before the U.S. invasion.\n\nThe other argument made here is that Iran has a terrible human rights record. How can the U.S. cut a deal with such a state?\n\nLeon Wieseltier, contributing editor of the venerable liberal journal The Atlantic, said that the U.S. should pursue \u201can American-sponsored alliance between Israel and the Sunni states\u201d. This is in reaction to his and others\u2019 outrage that the U.S. would make a deal with the \u201ccontemptible\u201d regime in Iran. Wieseltier can barely conceal his visceral hatred for all things Iranian. With a straight face, this respected liberal intellectual recommends that Saudi Arabia, which makes Iran look like a virtual paradise in comparison, and Israel, with its vicious crimes in Gaza and elsewhere, should ally to teach Iran good behaviour. Perhaps the recommendation is not entirely unreasonable when we consider the human rights records of the regimes the U.S. has imposed and supported throughout the world. The Iranian government is no doubt a threat to its own people, though it regrettably breaks no records in this regard and does not descend to the level of favoured allies [of the U.S.]. But that cannot be the concern of the U.S., and surely not Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt might also be useful to recall \u2014surely Iranians do\u2014that not a day has passed since 1953 when the U.S. was not severely harming Iranians. As soon as Iranians overthrew the hated U.S.-imposed regime of the Shah in 1979, Washington at once turned to supporting Saddam Hussein\u2019s murderous attack on Iran. Ronald Reagan went so far as to deny Saddam\u2019s major crime, his chemical warfare assault on Iraq\u2019s Kurdish population, which Reagan blamed on Iran. When Saddam was tried for crimes under U.S. auspices, this horrendous crime, and others in which the U.S. was complicit, were carefully excluded from the charges, restricted to one of his very minor crimes, the murder of 148 Shias in 1982, a footnote to his gruesome record.\n\nSaddam was such a valued friend of Washington that he was even granted a privilege accorded otherwise only to Israel: to attack a U.S. naval vessel with impunity, killing 37 crewmen\u2014the USS Stark, in 1987. Israel did the same in its 1967 attack on the USS Liberty. Iran pretty much conceded defeat shortly after when the U.S. launched Operation Praying Mantis against Iranian ships and oil platforms in Iranian territorial waters. The Operation culminated in the shooting down of an Iranian civilian airliner in Iranian airspace by USS Vincennes, under no credible threat, with 290 killed, and the subsequent granting of a Legion of Merit award to the Vincennes commander for \u201cexceptionally meritorious conduct\u201d and for maintaining a \u201ccalm and professional atmosphere\u201d during the period when the attack on the airliner took place. \u201cWe can only stand in awe of such display of American exceptionalism!\u201d Thill Raghu commented.\n\nAfter the war, the U.S. continued to support Iran\u2019s primary enemy, Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq. President Bush I, the statesman Bush, even invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the U.S. for advanced training in weapons production, an extremely serious threat to Iran. Sanctions against Iran were intensified, including against foreign firms dealing with Iran, along with actions to bar Iran from the international financial system.\n\nIn recent years, the hostility has extended to sabotage, murder of nuclear scientists [presumably by Israel], and cyberwar, openly proclaimed with pride. The Pentagon regards cyberwar as an act of war, justifying a military response, with the accord of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organisation], which affirmed in September 2014 that cyberattacks might trigger the collective defence obligations of the NATO powers. When we are the target that is, not the perpetrators.\n\nIt is only fair, however, to add that there have been breaks in the pattern. President Bush II provided several major gifts to Iran by destroying its major enemies, Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. He even placed Iran\u2019s Iraqi enemy under Iranian influence after the U.S. defeat, which was so severe that the U.S. had to abandon its officially declared goals of establishing military bases and ensuring privileged access to Iraq\u2019s vast oil resources for U.S. corporations.\n\nThere seems to be little evidence that the Iranians would ever use nuclear weapons. In 2005, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei delivered a fatwa (decree) against nuclear weapons. Why is there this belief that the Iranians are eager almost to use their non-existent nuclear weapons?\n\nWe can decide for ourselves how credible the denials from Iranian leaders are, but that they had such intentions in the past is beyond question, since it was asserted openly on the highest authority, which informed foreign journalists that Iran would develop nuclear weapons \u201ccertainly, and sooner than one thinks\u201d. The father of Iran\u2019s nuclear energy programme and former head of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organisation was confident that the leadership\u2019s plan \u201cwas to build a nuclear bomb\u201d. A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report also had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Iran would develop nuclear weapons if neighbouring countries did [as they have].\n\nAll of this was under the Shah, the highest authority just quoted. That is, during the period when high U.S. officials\u2014Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Henry Kissinger and others\u2014were urging the Shah to proceed with nuclear programmes, and pressuring universities to accommodate these efforts. As part of these efforts, my own university, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), made a deal with the Shah to admit Iranian students to the nuclear engineering programme in return for grants from the Shah, over the very strong objections of the student body, but with comparably strong faculty support, in a meeting that older faculty will doubtless remember well. Asked later why he supported these programmmes under the Shah but opposed them now, Kissinger responded honestly that Iran was an ally then.\n\nPutting aside absurdities, what is the real threat of Iran that inspires such fear and fury? A natural place to turn for an answer is, again, U.S. intelligence. Recall its analysis that Iran poses no military threat, that its strategic doctrines are defensive, and its nuclear programmmes [with no effort to produce bombs, as far as intelligence can determine] are \u201ca central part of its deterrent strategy\u201d.\n\nWho, then, would be concerned by an Iranian deterrent? The answer is plain: the rogue states that rampage in the region and do not want to tolerate any impediment to their reliance on aggression and violence. Far in the lead in this regard are the U.S. and Israel, with Saudi Arabia trying its best to join the club with its invasion of Bahrain to support the crushing of the reform movement by the dictatorship and now its murderous assault on Yemen, accelerating the humanitarian catastrophe there.\n\nCould you talk a bit more about these \u201crogue states\u201d? After all, this is not the typical characterisation of rogue states, a term developed in 1994 by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake to refer to North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Iran and Libya. Your list does not include these powers. It has the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nFifteen years ago, the Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard, the prominent political analyst Samuel Huntington, warned in the major establishment journal, Foreign Affairs, that for much of the world the U.S. was \u201cbecoming the rogue superpower\u201d considered \u201cthe single greatest external threat to their societies\u201d. His words were echoed shortly after by the president of the American Political Science Association, Robert Jervis, who observed, \u201cIn the eyes of much of the world, in fact, the prime rogue state today is the U.S.\u201d\n\nGlobal opinion supports this judgment by a substantial margin. According to the leading Western polling agencies (WIN/Gallup), the greatest threat to world peace is the U.S. Far below in second place is Pakistan, its ranking probably inflated by the Indian vote. Iran is ranked below, along with Israel, North Korea and Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S., by its own admission, is the gravest threat to world peace. That is the clear meaning of the insistence of the leadership and the political class, in media and commentary, that the U.S. reserves the right to resort to force if it determines, unilaterally, that Iran is violating some commitment. It is also a long-standing official stand of liberal democrats, for example the Clinton Doctrine, that the U.S. is entitled to resort to \u201cunilateral use of military power\u201d even for such purposes as to ensure \u201cuninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies and strategic resources\u201d, let alone alleged \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201chumanitarian\u201d concerns. And adherence to the doctrine is well confirmed in practice, as need hardly be discussed among people willing to look at the facts of current history.\n\nTurning to the next obvious question, what in fact is the Iranian threat? Why, for example, are Israel and Saudi Arabia trembling in fear over the threat of Iran? Whatever the threat is, it can hardly be military. U.S. intelligence years ago informed Congress that Iran had very low military expenditures by the standards of the region and that its strategic doctrines are defensive, designed to deter aggression. Intelligence reports further confirmed that there was no evidence that Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapons programme, and that \u201cIran\u2019s nuclear programme and its willingness to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons is a central part of its deterrent strategy.\u201d\n\nThe authoritative Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) review of global armament ranks the U.S., as usual, far in the lead in military expenditures, with China in second place at about one-third of U.S. expenditures. Far below are Russia and Saudi Arabia, well above any Western European state. Iran is scarcely mentioned. Full details are provided in an April study of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which finds \u201ca conclusive case that the Arab Gulf states have \u2026 an overwhelming advantage [over] Iran in both military spending and access to modern arms\u201d. Iran\u2019s military spending is a fraction of Saudi Arabia\u2019s, and is far below even the spending of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Altogether, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states\u2014Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE\u2014outspend Iran on arms by a factor of eight, an imbalance that goes back decades. The CSIS observes further that \u201cthe Arab Gulf states have acquired and are acquiring some of the most advanced and effective weapons in the world [while] Iran has essentially been forced to live in the past, often relying on systems originally delivered at the time of the Shah\u201d, which are virtually obsolete. The imbalance is, of course, even greater with Israel, which, along with the most advanced U.S. weaponry and its role as a virtual offshore military base of the global superpower, has a huge stock of nuclear weapons.\n\nFinally, could you say a little on what you just mentioned\u2014namely, on Israel\u2019s stockpile of nuclear weapons?\n\nIsrael, of course, is one of the three nuclear powers, along with India and Pakistan, whose nuclear weapons programmes have been abetted by the U.S. and who refuse to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif welcomed the nuclear deal and said that it was now the turn of the \u201choldout\u201d, namely Israel. The regular five-year NPT review conference ended in failure this April. One of the main reasons for the failure was that the U.S. once again blocked the efforts to move toward a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East [West Asia]. These efforts have been led by Egypt and other Arab states for 20 years. Two of the leading figures promoting them at the NPT and other U.N. agencies, and at the Pugwash conferences, Jayantha Dhanapala and Sergio Duarte, observe that \u201cthe successful adoption in 1995 of the resolution on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East was the main element of a package that permitted the indefinite extension of the NPT\u201d, the most important arms control treaty, which, were it adhered to, could end the scourge of nuclear weapons. Repeatedly, implementation of the resolution has been blocked by the U.S., most recently by Barack Obama in 2010 and again in 2015. Dhanapala and Duarte comment that the effort was again blocked \u201con behalf of a state that is not a party to the NPT and is widely believed to be the only one in the region possessing nuclear weapons\u201d, a polite and understated reference to Israel. They \u201chope that this failure will not be the coup de gr\u00e2ce to the two longstanding NPT objectives of accelerated progress on nuclear disarmament and on establishing a Middle Eastern WMD-free zone\u201d. Their article, in the journal of the Arms Control Association, is entitled: \u201cIs There a Future for the NPT?\u201d\n\nA nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East is a straightforward way to address whatever threat Iran allegedly poses. And a great deal more is at stake in Washington\u2019s continuing sabotage of the effort, protecting its Israeli client. This is not the only case when opportunities to end the alleged Iranian threat have been undermined by Washington, raising further questions about just what is actually at stake.\n\nThis interview originally appeared in Frontline (India)."], ["http://act.credoaction.com/sign/wildfire_funding?sp_ref=150171479.4.15932.t.66063.2&referring_akid=.193133.lkQ39t&source=tw_sp", "Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act... and make polluters pay for it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse.

Bernie Sanders has done little to alleviate the chief concern that Democrats have about his presidential bid: Namely, that he's simply unelectable on a national stage.\n\nThe Vermont Independent has quickly closed the gap on frontrunner Hillary Clinton in national polls, while overtaking the former State secretary in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Supporters say his rising momentum and populist message will carry him to the White House.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has spent a career operating largely from the left-most fringes of the Democratic Party with which he caucuses, stirring worry that he simply couldn't compete against a Republican perceived as a more establishment figure.\n\n\"No matter how well you think of Bernie \u2014 and all of us do \u2014 \u2026 when the politics of it all hits the road, I don't feel \u2014 and I feel most members don't feel \u2014 that he can be elected,\" said Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.).\n\nThe doubts have nothing to do with policy.\n\nIndeed, Sanders' career-long advocacy for economic and social justice \u2014 a vision of wider safety nets, higher wages, universal healthcare and corporate policing \u2014 overlaps almost directly with the policy priorities of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her liberal-leaning Democratic Caucus on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt's a convergence the Democrats have been quick to hail.\n\n\"I'm proud of what Bernie is saying out there, and it's a reflection of what we fight for here,\" Pelosi said last week.\n\nAnd yet there remains a lingering sense among many Democrats that a Sanders' nomination would spell doom for the party in 2016 \u2014 a sentiment highlighted by the fact that not a single Democrat in either chamber has endorsed the No. 2 primary contender.\n\n\"Bernie Sanders is raising some issues that are important,\" Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the Democratic whip and a Clinton supporter, told reporters last week. \"But I don't think there's an expectation that's he's going to be president of the United States.\"\n\nThe dynamics surrounding Sanders' campaign present Democrats with an uncomfortable question: If the candidate trumpeting the party's agenda most loudly and clearly is unelectable, what does it say about the agenda, itself?\n\nHastings, another Clinton backer, said the answer lies in political expediency. He said he supports Sanders' economic agenda to a tee. But he also remembers too well the losing presidential campaigns of liberals George McGovern and Eugene McCarthy \u2014 both of whom he supported in the Civil Rights era \u2014 as well as the saga surrounding Ralph Nader, the consumer-rights advocate turned third-party candidate he blames for securing George W. Bush's victory in 2000.\n\n\"Some argue, and I do, that Ralph Nader cost us that election \u2026 and I don't have time for that. And I think that's what members are saying: That I don't have time for fringes, at this point. And that's where Bernie is, and it's regrettable,\" Hastings said.\n\n\"Mine and Bernie's philosophies regarding the disparity of economic well-being of America's citizens [are] in direct alignment with each other. I agree with him \u2014 [but] I support Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) suggested Sanders' fierce advocacy has left little room for compromise, even with other Democrats.\n\n\"I tend to remind my progressive friends \u2026 that we've got to work together in order to accomplish something. And you don't do that by isolating the other side in your own party,\" said Pascrell, who's endorsed Clinton. \"In other words, it's my way or the highway. Sometimes I have that feeling about what Bernie is all about.\"\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who has not endorsed a primary candidate, said Sanders is doing \"a great job\" bringing the Democrats' policy agenda into the public eye. But he's concerned how the \"socialist\" label attached to the senator will play in a national election.\n\n\"The fact that he's been on that ticket raises some questions in other parts of the country: 'Can anyone who has ever had that label as an official candidate, as distinguished from an Independent, [win]?'\" Doggett asked. \"That's a question that many of us have had.\"\n\nThe doubts surrounding Sanders' electability are hardly universal. A growing number of lawmakers are pushing back as Sanders gains prominence in the race.\n\nRep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), a 2016 Senate candidate who has not endorsed a primary contender, characterized Sanders as one of Congress's most effective legislators, saying all claims that he's unelectable are \"politically motivated attacks\" designed to undermine his bid.\n\n\"Bernie has the appeal of being able to demonstrate to people that he can get good things done. He is not some kind of liberal stick figure; he's someone who has a record of actual accomplishment,\" Grayson said. \"If Bernie's the nominee, then Bernie very likely will be the next president of the United States.\"\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) echoed that message, warning that Democrats, by doubting Sanders' viability as a candidate, risk undermining the party's agenda.\n\n\"The expectation that he will fade, I think, is not true because the agenda he's putting forward, instead of tamping down momentum, it's increasing momentum. \u2026 He's ignited the base in a way that we haven't been able to do for six years,\" said Grijalva, the head of the Progressive Caucus who has not yet endorsed in the primary. \"So I would be very careful to marginalize the man. Because in a sense then you're marginalizing the message.\"\n\nAsked why Sanders hasn't won any Democratic endorsements, Grijalva predicted that would soon change.\n\n\"It'll come,\" he said.\n\nSanders has a long history of defying the odds, and at no instance more dramatically than now.\n\nThe 74-year old, who launched his candidacy in May with little fanfare, has seen his star rise quickly over the summer. He's raised tens of millions of dollars, mostly in small donations; his speeches have attracted the largest crowds of any candidate of either party; and, aided by an email scandal dogging Clinton's campaign, he has skyrocketed in the polls even as Clinton has fallen.\n\nThe latest CBS News/New York Times poll found that Clinton still holds a resounding edge, but her popularity has fallen from 58 to 47 percent in the last month as Sanders' numbers have jumped from 17 to 27 percent.\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) predicted Sanders' support would only grow as people become more familiar with his message. He said Sanders is doing \"a great job\" making the case for the Democrats policy platform \u2014 \"and articulating it better than Hillary Clinton, too.\"\n\nGutierrez, who has officially endorsed Clinton, suggested he's ready to spread his support around.\n\n\"I said I liked Hillary Clinton, but you know what? I like Bernie Sanders, too,\" he said."], ["http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4702232,00.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Police officer who accepted bribes sentenced to 8 years in jail", "Breaking News\n\nPolice officer who accepted bribes sentenced to 8 years in jail Yael Freidson Published: 09.20.15, 09:17 / Israel News Tweet Eran Malka, a police officer who accepted bribes from prominent Israeli lawyer Ronen Fisher, was sentenced to 8 years in prison Sunday.

It offers a buffer against responsibility, a way to shift blame and deflect cause and effect. But the truth, and numbers, tell a different story. At the heart of an increasingly violent society is not a subculture among Blacks, but the violence and criminality of many Americans, and whites in particular. No one seems to speak about this. Why?

Finally, their golden boy has admitted why that is.\n\nNate Silver is the closest thing there is to a mainstream media avatar for \u201cobjectivity,\u201d a polling whiz kid who is supposed to be an unflinching believer in data. On Friday night, Silver appeared on MSNBC\u2019s All In with Chris Hayes to discuss the racist (possibly planted) Donald Trump supporter who asserted President Obama\u2019s alleged Muslimhood and lack of American citizenship during a town hall meeting, and whom Trump failed to correct.\n\nThat incident naturally led to discussion of recent polls indicating that an overwhelming majority of Republicans (as much as 86%) wouldn\u2019t have corrected that guy, either. Right off the bat, Silver revealed, point blank, that he automatically resists ascribing things to racism, and then demonstrated that he\u2019s also willing to make stuff up in order to do that:\n\nSilver: \u201cThis may be my editorial bias. I tend to prefer explanations for the vote that don\u2019t, as a default, invoke race and Islamophobia and whatnot\u2026 \u201d \u201c\u2026PPP, not my favorite pollster, but 2/3 of Trump supporters believe that Obama is a Muslim. That\u2019s 54% of voters overall in the GOP primary electorate.\u201d Hayes: \u201cYou said PPP is a democratic-leaning firm, and I think they do poll sometimes, like, troll polls. But we\u2019ve got other polling, CNN polling that shows 43% of Republicans\u2026\u201d Silver: \u201cIt depends on how you ask the question. right? Some pollsters say \u2018What do you really think deep down,\u2019 so they ask in different ways.\u201d\n\nHere are two guys who sit suspensefully for years hoping they get to play the word \u201cempirical\u201d in a game of Scrabble, yet they each choose to ignore facts that lead them to an uncomfortable conclusion, and even make up a fake polling question to do it. They also neglected to mention that Silver\u2019s non-favorite pollster was also the most accurate pollster during the 2012 election, and even according to Silver himself produced results that tended to favor Mitt Romney.\n\nI confronted Hayes and Silver about this on Twitter Friday night, and only Hayes responded:\n\n@tommyxtopher @FiveThirtyEight @ppppolls never asserted that. In fact my point was that the data in other polls backs it up. \u2014 Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) September 19, 2015\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery to how PPP asked the question, because they printed it in their survey, and when Chuck Todd made the very same assertion that Silver did (and to which Hayes audibly agreed), I asked the pollster about it, just to be sure. While Hayes is correct that he did point to the CNN poll, discrediting the PPP poll has the effect of taking the Muslim assertion from a majority Republican view to a significant minority opinion, thus allowing the media, Silver, and Hayes to still consider that maybe this is all anger at Washington, and not what it plainly is: the crystallization of white male resentment.\n\nBut the poll questions actually are there for us to look at. PPP asked \u201cDo you think Barack Obama is a Christian or a Muslim, or are you not sure?\u201d which gave Republicans, at worst, a 50/50 shot at guessing correctly, or saying they weren\u2019t sure, like Scott Walker. CNN, on the other hand, gave voters seven choices, and did not offer them \u201cnot sure\u201d as an option. They also didn\u2019t ask voters what religion they \u201cthink\u201d Obama belongs to, they asked \u201cDo you happen to know what religion Barack Obama is? Is he Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, Muslim, something else, or not religious?\u201d\n\nTherefore, you could easily interpret these polls to mean that while 28% of Republicans are willing to concede that President Obama professes to be a Christian, only 14% of them actually believe that. I\u2019m not even saying you should discount the CNN poll, I\u2019m saying you shouldn\u2019t discount either of them, and certainly not by making something up or following a preconceived bias.\n\nSo why do it? I don\u2019t know Nate Silver, but Chris Hayes is an extremely intelligent guy who suffers from Acute Chronic Good Faith Syndrome. Like Hayes, I have a lot of very good friends who are also prominent conservatives. He and I first met at a CPAC afterparty hosted by Michelle Malkin, and we both know a lot of conservatives who aren\u2019t just nice, but are some of the most decent and wonderful people in the world. I understand how hard it would be to look a good friend in the eye, someone like Ed Morrissey or Matt Lewis or Ben Domenech, and say \u201cMost of your party is racist.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s the fact, Jack, and it\u2019s not crazy liberal Tommy Christopher saying that. These polls demonstrate, empirically, that the birther/secret Muslim view is held by a majority of Republicans, and tolerated by almost all of them, and several prominent Republicans have said that those views are racist, and science says it, too. I love my conservative friends, and it pains me that this is not a deal-breaker for them.\n\nHaving a bias against attributing things to racism is one thing if you\u2019re a political commentator looking to engage with the other side, but for a renowned pollster like Nate Silver, it\u2019s like a doctor announcing he\u2019s got a diagnostic bias against attributing things to cancer.

It was more like Darkness at Noon. Jeb Bush did call for the party to embrace a Reaganesque sense of optimism, which he contrasted with \u201cthe Donald Trump approach of \u2018Everything is bad, everything is coming to an end.\u201d But with occasional exceptions, usually involving the softer-edged John Kasich, the Trump approach dominated. For five hours, the candidates stood in front of Reagan\u2019s plane and described America as a declining nation in a dystopic world, as they pledged, to borrow a phrase, to Make America Great Again.\n\nThe big question of 2016 could well be whether Americans agree with the Republican portrait of Obama-era malaise. It was taken for granted last night that the national debt is out of control, the economy is deteriorating, the government is corrupt, and the world, as Lindsey Graham put it, is \u201con fire.\u201d Rubio complained that \u201cour left-wing government is undermining all the institutions that support the family.\u201d Ted Cruz declared that the Iran nuclear deal would turn the Obama administration into the world\u2019s largest financier of Islamic terror. Chris Christie said the middle class \u201cis getting plowed over by Barack Obama.\u201d The one thing the Republicans didn\u2019t seem too concerned about was climate change, which they agreed was not a problem worthy of solutions that might increase utility bills at a time when average Americans, as Rick Santorum put it, \u201care losing ground.\u201d\n\nObama provided an alternative view yesterday before the debate, making the case before the Business Roundtable that \u201cAmerica\u2019s great right now.\u201d He later tweeted some supporting evidence that wasn\u2019t mentioned last night on CNN: U.S. businesses have added 13 million jobs over 66 straight months of employment growth, with the jobless rate dropping from 10% to 5%. The budget deficit has fallen from nearly 10% of GDP to less than 3% under Obama, while the uninsured rate has fallen from 15.4% to 9.2% under Obamacare. The U.S. auto industry, on the brink of extinction before Obama\u2019s bailout, is on pace for its best year since 2001.\n\nBut last night wasn\u2019t really about evidence, although several candidates did mention that wages are stagnant, and Bush noted the \u201clabor participation rate\u201d has been declining since 1977. There was a consensus on stage that illegal immigration is a national crisis\u2014an \u201cincredible problem,\u201d said Ben Carson\u2014even though the population of undocumented immigration has actually declined by about 1 million under Obama. Carson also bemoaned how little has been done to push oil independence; in fact, oil imports from the Middle East just hit a 28-year low. Listening to Graham, Rubio and Fiorina decrying the weakness of the military and the need for a much larger navy, a listener never would have guessed that the U.S. spends five times as much as any other country on defense.\n\nThere was some debate about the Iraq War, and Trump mentioned the financial cataclysm of 2008, but some of the candidates openly pined for the good old days of George W. Bush. It wasn\u2019t just Jeb who credited his brother with keeping the country safe; Christie added that Obama had stripped away that safety, even though the September 11 attacks were on Bush\u2019s watch, and nothing similar has happened since. Fiorina actually seemed to suggest the economy was better when Lehman Brothers was collapsing in September 2008, suggesting that \u201cin seven short years the president has stolen our belief that our children will have a better future.\u201d\n\nThe doom and gloom was especially intense around foreign affairs, with general agreement that, as Jeb Bush put it, \u201cthis administration has created insecurity the likes of which we never could have imagined.\u201d Rubio threw around words like \u201capocalyptic\u201d to describe the danger of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal. There were numerous references to the danger that ISIS poses to the American homeland. Trump asked why no one seemed to be worrying about the North Korean threat.\n\n\u201cThis world,\u201d he summed up, \u201cis a mess.\u201d\n\nIn this woe-a-thon, it was interesting to hear Kasich talk about his desire to give people \u201ca sense of hope, a sense of unity, a sense we can do it,\u201d he said. He sounded more genuinely Reaganesque than Bush, who talks about running a joyful campaign the way unhappy people often telling their friends how happy they are.\n\nBut for now, the Republican Party is Trump\u2019s party, and it was amusing to watch also-rans like Bobby Jindal try to play Trump on TV. Jindal described an America where illegal immigration is a national nightmare, where anti-Christian discrimination is a national epidemic, and the Republican Party\u2014which has failed to defund Planned Parenthood or block the Iran Deal\u2014is a national disgrace.\n\nOn that last point, at least, Obama probably agrees."], ["http://www.alternet.org/world/noam-chomsky-why-republican-radical-insurgency-so-panicked-about-iran-nuclear-deal", "Noam Chomsky: Why the Republican 'Radical Insurgency' Is So Panicked About the Iran Nuclear Deal", "Noam Chomsky: Why the Republican 'Radical Insurgency' Is So Panicked About the Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nNoam Chomsky.\n\nPhoto Credit: Raw Story\n\nOn September 2, the United States\u2019 support for the Iran nuclear deal was secured. President Barack Obama\u2019s team negotiated the deal along with other countries of the P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and Germany). The Republicans in the U.S. Congress had threatened to pass a resolution that would block Obama\u2019s signature on such a deal. Obama had said he would veto any Bill that constrained his hand to sign that deal. He needed 34 Senators to back him in order to secure his veto. When Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland said she would support the President, the deal was safe.\n\nPhyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C., told me that Barbara Mikulski\u2019s vote was \u201ca big relief\u201d. She said that the Iran deal was \u201ca huge victory for diplomacy over the real threat of war with Iran\u201d. Trita Parsi and Reza Marashi of the National Iranian American Council agreed. Obama, they said, \u201chas proven to the U.S. that security is better achieved through diplomacy than through militarism\u201d. Emad Kiyaei of the American Iranian Council told me just after Barbara Mikulski\u2019s announcement: \u201cThere is no \u2018better\u2019 deal and the opposition has not introduced a viable alternative, except more coercive policies that to date have not slowed\u2014rather accelerated\u2014Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\u201d\n\nIn late August, Obama suggested that those who agreed with him were \u201cthe crazies\u201d. This suggested the strong push the White House had made to get the deal through. No wonder that the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Danielle Pletka told me that Obama was more belligerent with the Congress than the Iranian negotiators. \u201cI only wish the President had brought the same tenacity and purpose to the Iran talks,\u201d she told me, \u201cthan he brought to bludgeoning the representatives of the American people.\u201d\n\nTo get the wider context of the Iranian deal, I spoke to Professor Noam Chomsky, who laid out the geopolitical and historical context for this important agreement. \u2014 Vijay Prashad\n\nProfessor Chomsky, how would you characterise the Republican Party\u2019s reaction to the Iran nuclear deal?\n\nThe Republicans are almost unanimously opposed to the nuclear deal. The current Republican primaries illustrate the proclaimed reasons. Ted Cruz, considered one of the intellectuals of the group, warned that Iran may still be able to produce nuclear weapons, and it could use one to set off an electromagnetic pulse that \u201cwould take down the electrical grid of the entire eastern seaboard\u201d of the U.S., killing \u201ctens of millions of Americans\u201d. The two most likely winners of the primary, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, are battling over whether to bomb Iran immediately after being elected or after the first Cabinet meeting. The one candidate with some foreign policy experience, Lindsey Graham, described the deal as \u201ca death sentence for the State of Israel,\u201d which came as a surprise to Israeli intelligence and strategic analysts\u2014and which Graham too knows to be utter nonsense, raising immediate questions about actual motives.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that the Republicans have long abandoned the pretence of functioning as a normal parliamentary party. Rather, they have become a \u201cradical insurgency\u201d that scarcely seeks to participate in normal parliamentary politics, as observed by the respected conservative political commentator Norman Ornstein of the right-wing American Enterprise Institute. Since Ronald Reagan, the leadership has plunged so far into the pockets of the very rich and the corporate sector that they can attract votes only by mobilising sectors of the population that have not previously been an organised political force, among them extremist evangelical Christians, now probably the majority of Republican voters; remnants of the former slave-holding States; nativists who are terrified that \u201cthey\u201d are taking our white Christian Anglo-Saxon country away from us; and others who turn the Republican primaries into spectacles remote from the mainstream of modern society\u2014though not the mainstream of the most powerful country in world history.\n\nThe Republican suspicion of Iran seems to be shared across sections of the political spectrum, even among those who are for the deal. Could you address that suspicion of Iran?\n\nAcross the spectrum, there is general agreement with the \u201cpragmatic\u201d conclusion of General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the Vienna deal \u201cdid not prevent the U.S. from striking Iranian facilities if officials decide that it is cheating on the agreement\u201d, even though a unilateral military strike is \u201cfar less likely\u201d if Iran behaves. Former Clinton and Obama Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross recommends that \u201cIran must have no doubt that if we see it moving towards a weapon, that would trigger the use of force\u201d even after the termination of the deal, when Iran is free to do what it wants. In fact, the existence of a termination point 15 years hence is \u201cthe greatest single problem with the agreement,\u201d he adds, recommending that the U.S. provide Israel with B-52 bombers to protect itself before that terrifying date arrives.\n\nThe underlying assumption here is that Iran is a serious threat, that it would attack Israel with nuclear weapons. How credible is that threat?\n\nTo be sure, Israel faces the \u201cexistential threat\u201d of Iranian pronouncements: Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad famously threatened it with destruction. Except that they didn\u2019t\u2014and if they had, it would be of little moment. They predicted that \u201cUnder God\u2019s grace [the Zionist regime] will be wiped off the map.\u201d Another translation suggests that Ahmadinejad actually said that Israel \u201cmust vanish from the page of time\u201d. This is a citation of a statement made by Ayatollah Khomeini, during a period when Iran and Israel were tacitly allied. In other words, they hope that regime change will someday take place. They do not say that they will attack Israel either now or later.\n\nAhmadinejad\u2019s threats fall far short of regular U.S.-Israeli direct calls for regime change in Iran, not to speak of actions to implement regime change going back to the actual \u201cregime change\u201d of 1953, when the U.S. organised a military coup to overthrow the Iranian parliamentary regime and install the dictatorship of the Shah, who proceeded with one of the world\u2019s worst human rights records. These crimes were known to readers of Amnesty International and other human rights organisations, but not to readers of the U.S. press, which has indeed devoted plenty of space to Iranian human rights violations, but only after 1979, when the U.S.-imposed regime was overthrown. The instructive facts are documented carefully in a study by Mansour Farhang and William Dorman.\n\nNone of this is a departure from the norm. The U.S., as is well known, holds the world championship in regime change, and Israel is no laggard either. The most destructive of Israel\u2019s invasions of Lebanon, in 1982, was explicitly aimed at regime change, along with securing its hold on the Occupied Territories. The pretexts offered were very thin, and collapsed at once. That too is not unusual and pretty much independent of the nature of the society, from the laments in the Declaration of Independence about the \u201cmerciless Indian savages\u201d to Hitler\u2019s defence of Germany from the \u201cwild terror\u201d of the Poles.\n\nNo serious analyst believes that Iran would ever use, or even threaten to use, a nuclear weapon if it had one, thus facing instant destruction. There is, however, real concern that a nuclear weapon might fall into jehadi hands\u2014not from Iran, where the threat is minuscule, but from the U.S. ally Pakistan, where it is very real.\n\nIn the journal of the (British) Royal Institute of International Affairs, two leading Pakistani nuclear scientists, Pervez Hoodbhoy and Zia Mian, write that increasing fears of \u201cmilitants seizing nuclear weapons or materials and unleashing nuclear terrorism [have led to] the creation of a dedicated force of over 20,000 troops to guard nuclear facilities [though] there is no reason to assume, however, that this force would be immune to the problems associated with the units guarding regular military facilities,\u201d which have frequently suffered attacks with \u201cinsider help\u201d. In brief, the problem is real, but is displaced by fantasies concocted for other reasons.\n\nProfessor Chomsky, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, has said that the problem is the \u201cinstability that Iran fuels beyond its nuclear programme\u201d. She echoed U.S. Defence Secretary Ashton Carter, who went to Israel\u2019s northern border and said, \u201cWe will continue to help Israel counter Iran\u2019s malign influence\u201d by supporting Hizbollah. The U.S., he intimated, reserved the right to use military force against Iran. Could you comment on this?\n\nPower\u2019s usage is standard: she defines \u201cstabilisation\u201d according to a peculiar logic. For instance, U.S. policy in Iraq is defined as stabilisation. What does that stabilisation look like? The U.S. invades a country, with hundreds of thousands killed and millions becoming refugees, along with barbarous torture and destruction that Iraqis compare to the Mongol invasions, leaving Iraq the unhappiest country in the world according to WIN/Gallup polls. It also ignited sectarian conflict that is tearing the region to shreds and laying the basis for the ISIS [Islamic State of Iraq and Syria] monstrosity along with its Saudi ally. That is stabilisation. The standard usage sometimes reaches levels that are almost surreal, as when liberal commentator James Chace, former editor of Foreign Affairs, explains that the U.S. sought to \u201cdestabilise a freely elected Marxist government in Chile\u201d because \u201cwe were determined to seek stability\u201d [under the Pinochet dictatorship].\n\nLet us consider the case of Hizbollah and Hamas. Both emerged in resistance to U.S.-backed Israeli violence and aggression, which vastly exceeds anything attributed to these organisations. Whatever one thinks about them, or other beneficiaries of Iranian support, Iran hardly ranks high in support for terror worldwide, even within the Muslim world. Among Islamic states, Saudi Arabia is far in the lead as a sponsor of Islamic terror, not only by direct funding by wealthy Saudis and others in the Gulf but even more by the missionary zeal with which the Saudis promulgate their extremist Wahhabi-Salafi version of Islam through Quranic schools, mosques, clerics, and other means available to a religious dictatorship with enormous oil wealth. The ISIS is an extremist offshoot of Saudi religious extremism and its fanning of jehadi flames.\n\nIn generation of Islamic terror, however, nothing can compare with the U.S. \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which has helped to spread the plague from a small tribal area in Afghanistan-Pakistan to a vast region from West Africa to South-East Asia. The invasion of Iraq alone escalated terror attacks by a factor of seven in the first year, well beyond even what had been predicted by intelligence agencies. Drone warfare against marginalised and oppressed tribal societies also elicits demands for revenge, as ample evidence indicates.\n\nThe two Iranian clients [Hizbollah and Hamas] also share the crime of winning the popular vote in the only free elections held in the Arab world. Hizbollah is guilty of the even more heinous crime of compelling Israel to withdraw from its occupation of southern Lebanon in violation of [U.N.] Security Council orders dating back decades, an illegal regime of terror punctuated with episodes of extreme violence, murder and destruction.\n\nIran\u2019s \u201cfuelling instability\u201d is particularly dramatic in Iraq, where, among other crimes, it alone came at once to the aid of Kurds defending themselves from the ISIS invasion and it is building a $2.5 billion power plant to try to bring electrical power back to the level before the U.S. invasion.\n\nThe other argument made here is that Iran has a terrible human rights record. How can the U.S. cut a deal with such a state?\n\nLeon Wieseltier, contributing editor of the venerable liberal journal The Atlantic, said that the U.S. should pursue \u201can American-sponsored alliance between Israel and the Sunni states\u201d. This is in reaction to his and others\u2019 outrage that the U.S. would make a deal with the \u201ccontemptible\u201d regime in Iran. Wieseltier can barely conceal his visceral hatred for all things Iranian. With a straight face, this respected liberal intellectual recommends that Saudi Arabia, which makes Iran look like a virtual paradise in comparison, and Israel, with its vicious crimes in Gaza and elsewhere, should ally to teach Iran good behaviour. Perhaps the recommendation is not entirely unreasonable when we consider the human rights records of the regimes the U.S. has imposed and supported throughout the world. The Iranian government is no doubt a threat to its own people, though it regrettably breaks no records in this regard and does not descend to the level of favoured allies [of the U.S.]. But that cannot be the concern of the U.S., and surely not Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt might also be useful to recall \u2014surely Iranians do\u2014that not a day has passed since 1953 when the U.S. was not severely harming Iranians. As soon as Iranians overthrew the hated U.S.-imposed regime of the Shah in 1979, Washington at once turned to supporting Saddam Hussein\u2019s murderous attack on Iran. Ronald Reagan went so far as to deny Saddam\u2019s major crime, his chemical warfare assault on Iraq\u2019s Kurdish population, which Reagan blamed on Iran. When Saddam was tried for crimes under U.S. auspices, this horrendous crime, and others in which the U.S. was complicit, were carefully excluded from the charges, restricted to one of his very minor crimes, the murder of 148 Shias in 1982, a footnote to his gruesome record.\n\nSaddam was such a valued friend of Washington that he was even granted a privilege accorded otherwise only to Israel: to attack a U.S. naval vessel with impunity, killing 37 crewmen\u2014the USS Stark, in 1987. Israel did the same in its 1967 attack on the USS Liberty. Iran pretty much conceded defeat shortly after when the U.S. launched Operation Praying Mantis against Iranian ships and oil platforms in Iranian territorial waters. The Operation culminated in the shooting down of an Iranian civilian airliner in Iranian airspace by USS Vincennes, under no credible threat, with 290 killed, and the subsequent granting of a Legion of Merit award to the Vincennes commander for \u201cexceptionally meritorious conduct\u201d and for maintaining a \u201ccalm and professional atmosphere\u201d during the period when the attack on the airliner took place. \u201cWe can only stand in awe of such display of American exceptionalism!\u201d Thill Raghu commented.\n\nAfter the war, the U.S. continued to support Iran\u2019s primary enemy, Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq. President Bush I, the statesman Bush, even invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the U.S. for advanced training in weapons production, an extremely serious threat to Iran. Sanctions against Iran were intensified, including against foreign firms dealing with Iran, along with actions to bar Iran from the international financial system.\n\nIn recent years, the hostility has extended to sabotage, murder of nuclear scientists [presumably by Israel], and cyberwar, openly proclaimed with pride. The Pentagon regards cyberwar as an act of war, justifying a military response, with the accord of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organisation], which affirmed in September 2014 that cyberattacks might trigger the collective defence obligations of the NATO powers. When we are the target that is, not the perpetrators.\n\nIt is only fair, however, to add that there have been breaks in the pattern. President Bush II provided several major gifts to Iran by destroying its major enemies, Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. He even placed Iran\u2019s Iraqi enemy under Iranian influence after the U.S. defeat, which was so severe that the U.S. had to abandon its officially declared goals of establishing military bases and ensuring privileged access to Iraq\u2019s vast oil resources for U.S. corporations.\n\nThere seems to be little evidence that the Iranians would ever use nuclear weapons. In 2005, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei delivered a fatwa (decree) against nuclear weapons. Why is there this belief that the Iranians are eager almost to use their non-existent nuclear weapons?\n\nWe can decide for ourselves how credible the denials from Iranian leaders are, but that they had such intentions in the past is beyond question, since it was asserted openly on the highest authority, which informed foreign journalists that Iran would develop nuclear weapons \u201ccertainly, and sooner than one thinks\u201d. The father of Iran\u2019s nuclear energy programme and former head of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organisation was confident that the leadership\u2019s plan \u201cwas to build a nuclear bomb\u201d. A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report also had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Iran would develop nuclear weapons if neighbouring countries did [as they have].\n\nAll of this was under the Shah, the highest authority just quoted. That is, during the period when high U.S. officials\u2014Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Henry Kissinger and others\u2014were urging the Shah to proceed with nuclear programmes, and pressuring universities to accommodate these efforts. As part of these efforts, my own university, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), made a deal with the Shah to admit Iranian students to the nuclear engineering programme in return for grants from the Shah, over the very strong objections of the student body, but with comparably strong faculty support, in a meeting that older faculty will doubtless remember well. Asked later why he supported these programmmes under the Shah but opposed them now, Kissinger responded honestly that Iran was an ally then.\n\nPutting aside absurdities, what is the real threat of Iran that inspires such fear and fury? A natural place to turn for an answer is, again, U.S. intelligence. Recall its analysis that Iran poses no military threat, that its strategic doctrines are defensive, and its nuclear programmmes [with no effort to produce bombs, as far as intelligence can determine] are \u201ca central part of its deterrent strategy\u201d.\n\nWho, then, would be concerned by an Iranian deterrent? The answer is plain: the rogue states that rampage in the region and do not want to tolerate any impediment to their reliance on aggression and violence. Far in the lead in this regard are the U.S. and Israel, with Saudi Arabia trying its best to join the club with its invasion of Bahrain to support the crushing of the reform movement by the dictatorship and now its murderous assault on Yemen, accelerating the humanitarian catastrophe there.\n\nCould you talk a bit more about these \u201crogue states\u201d? After all, this is not the typical characterisation of rogue states, a term developed in 1994 by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake to refer to North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Iran and Libya. Your list does not include these powers. It has the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nFifteen years ago, the Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard, the prominent political analyst Samuel Huntington, warned in the major establishment journal, Foreign Affairs, that for much of the world the U.S. was \u201cbecoming the rogue superpower\u201d considered \u201cthe single greatest external threat to their societies\u201d. His words were echoed shortly after by the president of the American Political Science Association, Robert Jervis, who observed, \u201cIn the eyes of much of the world, in fact, the prime rogue state today is the U.S.\u201d\n\nGlobal opinion supports this judgment by a substantial margin. According to the leading Western polling agencies (WIN/Gallup), the greatest threat to world peace is the U.S. Far below in second place is Pakistan, its ranking probably inflated by the Indian vote. Iran is ranked below, along with Israel, North Korea and Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S., by its own admission, is the gravest threat to world peace. That is the clear meaning of the insistence of the leadership and the political class, in media and commentary, that the U.S. reserves the right to resort to force if it determines, unilaterally, that Iran is violating some commitment. It is also a long-standing official stand of liberal democrats, for example the Clinton Doctrine, that the U.S. is entitled to resort to \u201cunilateral use of military power\u201d even for such purposes as to ensure \u201cuninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies and strategic resources\u201d, let alone alleged \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201chumanitarian\u201d concerns. And adherence to the doctrine is well confirmed in practice, as need hardly be discussed among people willing to look at the facts of current history.\n\nTurning to the next obvious question, what in fact is the Iranian threat? Why, for example, are Israel and Saudi Arabia trembling in fear over the threat of Iran? Whatever the threat is, it can hardly be military. U.S. intelligence years ago informed Congress that Iran had very low military expenditures by the standards of the region and that its strategic doctrines are defensive, designed to deter aggression. Intelligence reports further confirmed that there was no evidence that Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapons programme, and that \u201cIran\u2019s nuclear programme and its willingness to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons is a central part of its deterrent strategy.\u201d\n\nThe authoritative Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) review of global armament ranks the U.S., as usual, far in the lead in military expenditures, with China in second place at about one-third of U.S. expenditures. Far below are Russia and Saudi Arabia, well above any Western European state. Iran is scarcely mentioned. Full details are provided in an April study of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which finds \u201ca conclusive case that the Arab Gulf states have \u2026 an overwhelming advantage [over] Iran in both military spending and access to modern arms\u201d. Iran\u2019s military spending is a fraction of Saudi Arabia\u2019s, and is far below even the spending of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Altogether, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states\u2014Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE\u2014outspend Iran on arms by a factor of eight, an imbalance that goes back decades. The CSIS observes further that \u201cthe Arab Gulf states have acquired and are acquiring some of the most advanced and effective weapons in the world [while] Iran has essentially been forced to live in the past, often relying on systems originally delivered at the time of the Shah\u201d, which are virtually obsolete. The imbalance is, of course, even greater with Israel, which, along with the most advanced U.S. weaponry and its role as a virtual offshore military base of the global superpower, has a huge stock of nuclear weapons.\n\nFinally, could you say a little on what you just mentioned\u2014namely, on Israel\u2019s stockpile of nuclear weapons?\n\nIsrael, of course, is one of the three nuclear powers, along with India and Pakistan, whose nuclear weapons programmes have been abetted by the U.S. and who refuse to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif welcomed the nuclear deal and said that it was now the turn of the \u201choldout\u201d, namely Israel. The regular five-year NPT review conference ended in failure this April. One of the main reasons for the failure was that the U.S. once again blocked the efforts to move toward a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East [West Asia]. These efforts have been led by Egypt and other Arab states for 20 years. Two of the leading figures promoting them at the NPT and other U.N. agencies, and at the Pugwash conferences, Jayantha Dhanapala and Sergio Duarte, observe that \u201cthe successful adoption in 1995 of the resolution on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East was the main element of a package that permitted the indefinite extension of the NPT\u201d, the most important arms control treaty, which, were it adhered to, could end the scourge of nuclear weapons. Repeatedly, implementation of the resolution has been blocked by the U.S., most recently by Barack Obama in 2010 and again in 2015. Dhanapala and Duarte comment that the effort was again blocked \u201con behalf of a state that is not a party to the NPT and is widely believed to be the only one in the region possessing nuclear weapons\u201d, a polite and understated reference to Israel. They \u201chope that this failure will not be the coup de gr\u00e2ce to the two longstanding NPT objectives of accelerated progress on nuclear disarmament and on establishing a Middle Eastern WMD-free zone\u201d. Their article, in the journal of the Arms Control Association, is entitled: \u201cIs There a Future for the NPT?\u201d\n\nA nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East is a straightforward way to address whatever threat Iran allegedly poses. And a great deal more is at stake in Washington\u2019s continuing sabotage of the effort, protecting its Israeli client. This is not the only case when opportunities to end the alleged Iranian threat have been undermined by Washington, raising further questions about just what is actually at stake.\n\nThis interview originally appeared in Frontline (India)."], ["http://act.credoaction.com/sign/PP_Hold_the_Line?sp_ref=150157619.4.15659.t.64876.2&referring_akid=.6985257.QVRC6H&source=tw_sp", "Democrats can\u2019t compromise when it comes to Planned Parenthood", "\"Democrats in Congress must stand strong against any Republican attacks on women. No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:"], ["http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-deal-will-facilitate-and-accelerate-/", "Ted Cruz says deal will 'facilitate and accelerate' Iran getting a nuclear bomb", "Along with Donald Trump and the Tea Party Patriots, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke out harshly against a nuclear agreement with Iran at the U.S. Capitol. When the rally was over, Cruz followed up by tweeting out video clips of some of his comments.\n\n\"The #IranDeal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons,\" he said in a tweet on Sept. 9, 2015.\n\nHis comment caught our attention. We wondered whether it was accurate that the agreement would actually make it easier -- not harder -- for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhat the deal will do\n\nFirst, let\u2019s recap what the deal would do. Broadly speaking, Iran would agree to accept strict curbs on nuclear technologies and intrusive access by nuclear-weapons inspectors for 10 to 25 years, with a pledge to abide by existing international treaties limiting its nuclear ambitions in perpetuity. In exchange, international economic sanctions against Iran would be lifted, as long as Iran doesn\u2019t cheat. If Iran did cheat, sanctions could be reimposed.\n\nSpecifically, the deal requires Iran to give up 97 percent of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, the kind needed to make nuclear weapons, as well as most of the centrifuges it can use to enrich uranium. In addition, Iran agrees to only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for 15 years, and to cease production of plutonium, the other element that can be used to build a bomb. Known nuclear sites would be monitored for 15 years to confirm compliance, and inspectors would have the ability to enter undeclared sites suspected of nuclear use, though with possible delays of up to 24 days.\n\nIf Iran were to abide by these rules for 10 years, scientists say it would take them at least 12 months to build a weapon.\n\nCruz's case\n\nCruz\u2019s staff did not respond to inquiries for this story, and we could find only one nuclear-policy expert who thought Cruz\u2019s claim may have some merit.\n\nMichaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it depends on whether and when Iran cheats on the deal. \"There\u2019s a some degree of assumption that Iran will cheat in this, which isn\u2019t entirely unreasonable given Iran\u2019s history,\" she said. \"Let\u2019s say Iran abides by the deal just long enough to have sanctions lifted and lucrative contracts signed, and then pulls out, you can make the case\" that Cruz does, she said.\n\nThis might mean Iran sticking with the agreement for two years, then pulling out and pursuing a weapon, Dodge said.\n\nStill, even this scenario -- problematic though it would be geopolitically -- would enable two years of tight international scrutiny of Iran\u2019s nuclear program that would not otherwise exist without the agreement.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if today\u2019s economic sanctions against Iran are expected to live on if the agreement fails to be enacted. Most observers assume that U.S. allies will begin loosening key sanctions whether or not the agreement is implemented.\n\n\"The European Union has already begun the process of suspending its sanctions on Iran, and the U.N. Security Council likewise wasted no time in passing a resolution for sanctions relief, though it delayed implementation for 90 days,\" Suzanne Nossel, a former deputy assistant secretary of state at the U.S. State Department, recently wrote in Foreign Policy. \"While congressional naysayers now trumpet the success of sanctions and demand that they remain in place, experts uniformly affirm that their effectiveness depends on wide multilateral support.\"\n\nObstacles to an Iranian bomb\n\nAll the other nuclear-policy experts we checked with said the deal puts roadblocks in the way of Iran's effort to pursue a nuclear weapon -- roadblocks that wouldn\u2019t exist if the deal simply fell apart.

Opponents have argued that it simply delays by a decade or so Iran\u2019s eventual acquisition of a bomb, or that the United States and its allies should have negotiated stronger protections, or that by agreeing to the deal, the United States is giving its tacit approval to Iran moving toward a bomb after the deal\u2019s strongest provisions expire.\n\nBut compared to letting the deal evaporate, it\u2019s hard to see how enactment of the deal makes it easier for Iran to get a bomb.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCruz said, \"The Iran Deal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThe Iran deal may be less than perfect, but experts say it\u2019s hard to see how implementing the agreement -- rather than doing nothing at all -- would actually \"facilitate and accelerate\" an Iranian nuclear weapon.

We\u2019re talking about reminding the world of things that everyone knows - not only the clearly bad but also the lack of anything good.\n\nIf there\u2019s any downside to Fiorina hitting this so well, I think it could be that a narrative develops whereby only Fiorina - because she\u2019s a woman - can really lay the smack to Hillary as the smack needs to be laid.\n\nAssuming someone else wins the nomination, you could envision a scenario in which the male nominee makes Fiorina his go-to person for no-holds-barred Hillary attacks - while he stays blissfully above the fray. I think that would be a mistake. The nominee has to be able to present a positive vision for the country, first of all, and a solid plan for solving the nation\u2019s problems. But he also has to be able to express in clear terms not only why Hillary would be such a terrible president, but why the Democratic Party deserves the nation\u2019s eternal scorn for nominating such a craptastic individual for the highest office in the land.\n\nWhat Fiorina has done here is show how it\u2019s done.

But it should be over legitimate issues like how much do we invest in education, job training, and infrastructure \u2013 not unrelated ideological issues like Planned Parenthood. We need to set our sights higher than that. We need to reverse harmful cuts to middle-class economic priorities, close loopholes that benefit only a fortunate few at the top, and invest more in the things that help our entire economy grow.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing principled about the idea of another government shutdown. There\u2019s nothing patriotic about denying the progress you\u2019ve worked so hard to make. America is great right now \u2013 not because of our government, or our wealth, or our power, but because of everyone who works hard every day to move this country forward. Now Congress needs to work as hard as you do.\n\nThe reality is that if President Obama says defunding Planned Parenthood is an illegitimate issue that means that Republicans have no chance of seeing it happen.\n\nHouse Republicans can throw a tantrum and shut down the government, but Obama is never going to sign off on defunding Planned Parenthood. Any funding plan that defunded the organization would be dead before it hit the President\u2019s desk.\n\nTucked inside of the President\u2019s call for Republicans to pass a responsible budget was a massive reality bomb that should make the right shudder. Republicans have already lost the fight to defund Planned Parenthood, and a government shutdown would only serve to expand their losses to include the 2016 election."], ["http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/09/policy-analysis-cnn-gop-debate-000244", "The \u2018Everything is Bad\u2019 party", "America\u2019s potential, said Carly Fiorina, is being \u201ccrushed.\u201d America\u2019s military, said Marco Rubio, is being \u201ceviscerated.\u201d Working people, said Mike Huckabee, are \u201ctaking a gut punch.\u201d The idea of America, said Bobby Jindal, is \u201cslipping away.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, as usual, went even further: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a country.\u201d\n\nLast night\u2019s Republican debate in the Reagan Library was not about Morning in America. It was more like Darkness at Noon. Jeb Bush did call for the party to embrace a Reaganesque sense of optimism, which he contrasted with \u201cthe Donald Trump approach of \u2018Everything is bad, everything is coming to an end.\u201d But with occasional exceptions, usually involving the softer-edged John Kasich, the Trump approach dominated. For five hours, the candidates stood in front of Reagan\u2019s plane and described America as a declining nation in a dystopic world, as they pledged, to borrow a phrase, to Make America Great Again.\n\nThe big question of 2016 could well be whether Americans agree with the Republican portrait of Obama-era malaise. It was taken for granted last night that the national debt is out of control, the economy is deteriorating, the government is corrupt, and the world, as Lindsey Graham put it, is \u201con fire.\u201d Rubio complained that \u201cour left-wing government is undermining all the institutions that support the family.\u201d Ted Cruz declared that the Iran nuclear deal would turn the Obama administration into the world\u2019s largest financier of Islamic terror. Chris Christie said the middle class \u201cis getting plowed over by Barack Obama.\u201d The one thing the Republicans didn\u2019t seem too concerned about was climate change, which they agreed was not a problem worthy of solutions that might increase utility bills at a time when average Americans, as Rick Santorum put it, \u201care losing ground.\u201d\n\nObama provided an alternative view yesterday before the debate, making the case before the Business Roundtable that \u201cAmerica\u2019s great right now.\u201d He later tweeted some supporting evidence that wasn\u2019t mentioned last night on CNN: U.S. businesses have added 13 million jobs over 66 straight months of employment growth, with the jobless rate dropping from 10% to 5%. The budget deficit has fallen from nearly 10% of GDP to less than 3% under Obama, while the uninsured rate has fallen from 15.4% to 9.2% under Obamacare. The U.S. auto industry, on the brink of extinction before Obama\u2019s bailout, is on pace for its best year since 2001.\n\nBut last night wasn\u2019t really about evidence, although several candidates did mention that wages are stagnant, and Bush noted the \u201clabor participation rate\u201d has been declining since 1977. There was a consensus on stage that illegal immigration is a national crisis\u2014an \u201cincredible problem,\u201d said Ben Carson\u2014even though the population of undocumented immigration has actually declined by about 1 million under Obama. Carson also bemoaned how little has been done to push oil independence; in fact, oil imports from the Middle East just hit a 28-year low. Listening to Graham, Rubio and Fiorina decrying the weakness of the military and the need for a much larger navy, a listener never would have guessed that the U.S. spends five times as much as any other country on defense.\n\nThere was some debate about the Iraq War, and Trump mentioned the financial cataclysm of 2008, but some of the candidates openly pined for the good old days of George W. Bush. It wasn\u2019t just Jeb who credited his brother with keeping the country safe; Christie added that Obama had stripped away that safety, even though the September 11 attacks were on Bush\u2019s watch, and nothing similar has happened since. Fiorina actually seemed to suggest the economy was better when Lehman Brothers was collapsing in September 2008, suggesting that \u201cin seven short years the president has stolen our belief that our children will have a better future.\u201d\n\nThe doom and gloom was especially intense around foreign affairs, with general agreement that, as Jeb Bush put it, \u201cthis administration has created insecurity the likes of which we never could have imagined.\u201d Rubio threw around words like \u201capocalyptic\u201d to describe the danger of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal. There were numerous references to the danger that ISIS poses to the American homeland. Trump asked why no one seemed to be worrying about the North Korean threat.\n\n\u201cThis world,\u201d he summed up, \u201cis a mess.\u201d\n\nIn this woe-a-thon, it was interesting to hear Kasich talk about his desire to give people \u201ca sense of hope, a sense of unity, a sense we can do it,\u201d he said. He sounded more genuinely Reaganesque than Bush, who talks about running a joyful campaign the way unhappy people often telling their friends how happy they are.\n\nBut for now, the Republican Party is Trump\u2019s party, and it was amusing to watch also-rans like Bobby Jindal try to play Trump on TV. Jindal described an America where illegal immigration is a national nightmare, where anti-Christian discrimination is a national epidemic, and the Republican Party\u2014which has failed to defund Planned Parenthood or block the Iran Deal\u2014is a national disgrace.\n\nOn that last point, at least, Obama probably agrees."], ["http://netrightdaily.com/2014/06/racial-quotas-local-zoning-decisions/?utm_source=WhatCounts+Publicaster+Edition&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Racial+quotas+for+local+zoning+decisions%3F&utm_content=Racial+quotas+for+local+zoning+decisions%3F", "Racial quotas for local zoning decisions?", "By Robert Romano\n\nIn October, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is set to finalize a rulemaking to condition eligibility for community development block grants on redrawing zoning maps to achieve racial and income integration.\n\nIn 2012, HUD dispersed about $3.8 billion of these grants to almost 1,200 municipalities. These range from the rather small \u2014 Nashua, N.H. received $583,000 that year. To the rather large \u2014 New York City received $210.9 million of the grants.\n\nNow, under the new rule, HUD will empower itself to nationalize local zoning decisions in every single one of these localities in an attempt to create evenly distributed neighborhoods based on racial composition and income.\n\n\u201cThis is a utopian pipe dream, and social engineering at its worst,\u201d Americans for Limited Government President Nathan Mehrens said.\n\n\u201cNeighborhoods are constituted not based on racial quotas, but on economics,\u201d he added.\n\nMehrens called on the House of Representatives to defund implementation of the rule via a rider to the Transportation and HUD appropriations bill coming up next week.\n\nA trial run for the rule has already occurred in Westchester County, N.Y., where the department has attempted for years to rezone the area as a condition for receiving millions in grants.\n\nCounty Executive Rob Astorino, a Republican, told HUD to go pound sand, and simply rejected the receipt of $5 million of grants from 2012.\n\nWestchester lost out on some $7 million of grants from 2011 for the same reason.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that HUD, which claims to champion the needy, once again is threatening to withhold funds for affordable housing,\u201d said Astorino spokesman Ned McCormack in April. \u201cBut the county is not going to turn over control of the local zoning of its six cities, 19 towns and 20 villages to bureaucrats in Washington for $5 million in grants.\u201d\n\nHUD was demanding that the county build 750 units of affordable housing in 31 more affluent communities.\n\nNow, Astorino, running for governor this year against Andrew Cuomo, is challenging in federal court the legal basis under which HUD can even condition the grants in exchange for changes to zoning.\n\nNow, call me a cynic, but this probably has nothing at all to do with integrating communities on the basis of race or income. More likely, this is a pretext to tilt the political scales on the national and local political scenes for the next generation to favor Democrats.\n\nIt is no secret that Republicans with their low tax message tend to do better among the middle and upper middle classes, while Democrats with their social welfare regime tend to do better among the poor.\n\nThe solution for Democrats? Via regulation, force communities dependent on federal funding to build more homes and apartments where Democrats are likely to live.\n\nIf for no other reason, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives should defund the new rulemaking, which represents an existential threat to its continued viability as a national political party.\n\nBut, leaving that aside, it\u2019s also completely insane from a policy standpoint. Forcing wealthier communities to build so-called affordable housing units could depress property values, increase local taxes, and place a greater strain on public services.\n\nIt also violates the constitutional balance of powers between the federal, state, and local governments. The federal government has zero role, constitutionally, in local zoning decisions. That is a matter for county and municipal boards.\n\nBesides, it will not do a thing to alleviate actual housing discrimination, ALG\u2019s Mehrens noted, \u201cHousing discrimination based on race has been illegal for decades. There is no discrimination in people choosing for themselves where they want to live, and yet that is exactly what HUD is seeking to regulate.\u201d\n\nRobert Romano is the senior editor of Americans for Limited Government."], ["http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/planned-parenthood-carly-fiorina-debate-lying-213794?utm_content=buffer41add&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer", "September Republican debate: Planned Parenthood accuses Carly Fiorina of lying during debate", "AP Photo Planned Parenthood accuses Fiorina of lying during debate\n\nPlanned Parenthood fired back Thursday at Carly Fiorina's characterization of videos released by anti-abortion activists by calling her a liar.\n\n\"I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes.

A government that fails to care for our men and women on the frontlines is guilty of malpractice. A government that puts the needs of illegal aliens above U.S. veterans for political gain should be prosecuted for criminal neglect bordering on treason.\n\nCompare, contrast and weep:\n\nIn Sacramento, Calif., lawmakers are moving forward with a budget-busting plan to extend government-funded health insurance to at least 1.5 million illegal aliens.\n\nIn Los Angeles, federal bureaucrats callously canceled an estimated 40,000 diagnostic tests and treatments for American veterans with cancer and other illnesses to cover up a decade-long backlog.\n\nIn New York, doctors report that nearly 40 percent of their patients receiving kidney dialysis are illegal aliens. A survey of nephrologists in 44 states revealed that 65 percent of them treat illegal aliens with kidney disease.\n\nIn Memphis, a VA whistleblower reported that his hospital was using contaminated kidney dialysis machines to treat America's warriors. The same hospital previously had been investigated for chronic overcrowding at its emergency room, leading to six-hour waits or longer. Another watchdog probe found unconscionable delays in processing lab tests at the center. In addition, three patients died under negligent circumstances, and the hospital failed to enforce accountability measures.\n\nIn Arizona, illegal aliens incurred health care costs totaling an estimated $700 million in 2009.\n\nIn Phoenix, at least 40 veterans died waiting for VA hospitals and clinics to treat them, while government officials created secret waiting lists to cook the books and deceive the public about deadly treatment delays.\n\nAt the University of California at Berkeley, UC President Janet Napolitano (former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security) has offered $5 million in financial aid to illegal alien students. Across the country, 16 states offer in-state tuition discounts for illegal aliens: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington. In addition, the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and the University of Michigan Board of Regents all approved their own illegal alien tuition benefits.\n\nIn 2013, the nation's most selective colleges and universities had enrolled just 168 American veterans, down from 232 in 2011. Anti-war activists have waged war on military recruitment offices at elite campuses for years. The huge influx of illegal aliens in state universities is shrinking the number of state-subsidized slots for vets.\n\nIn 2013, the Obama Department of Homeland Security released 36,007 known, convicted criminal illegal aliens, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. The catch-and-release beneficiaries include thugs convicted of homicide, sexual assault, kidnapping, and thousands of drunk or drugged driving crimes.\n\nThe same Department of Homeland Security issued a report in 2009 that identified returning combat veterans as worrisome terrorist and criminal threats to America.\n\nIn Washington, Big Business and open-borders lobbyists are redoubling efforts to pass another massive illegal alien amnesty to flood the U.S. job market with low-wage labor.\n\nAcross the country, men and women in uniform returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan have higher jobless rates than the civilian population. The unemployment rate for new veterans has spiked to its worst levels, nearing 15 percent. For veterans ages 24 and under, the jobless rate is a whopping 29.1 percent, compared to 17.6 percent nationally for the age group.\n\nA Forbes columnist reported last year that an Air Force veteran was told: \"We don't hire your kind.\"\n\nAnd last December, Democrats led the charge to reduce cost-of-living increases in military pensions -- while blocking GOP Alabama Sen.

These are purely economic positions of course. Cigarettes are big business. So are oil, gas, and coal. Capitalism must not knuckle under for the sake of health of mere humans, not when the almighty dollar is at stake.\n\nNever mind the idolatry of worshiping money. But let\u2019s not let logic or common sense get in the way of a good, mindless, ideological diatribe:\n\nKoprowsky claimed,\n\nWhen the Vatican leapt into the controversy on climate science, we were initially under the impression that His Holiness was a victim of bad advice from bad advisers. There were people from the UN who were population control advocates. There were people from other left-wing groups who were advising the pontiff.\n\nThen came the Pope\u2019s encyclical \u201cOn Care for Our Common Home,\u201d which hardly broke new ground as it began with a quote from St. Francis of Assisi, referring to the earth, \u201cour common home\u201d as a sister, and traces the climate concerns of his predecessors, Paul VI and John Paul II.\n\nThis was too much for Koprowski: \u201cWhile we initially thought it was bad advisors, I think that something more may be afoot,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat was more serious was that same old bogeyman, science, but Koprowski sees something more sinister afoot:\n\nIt was a medieval festival, where masqueraders with grotesque masks took over the church and elected what was called a \u2018fool\u2019s pope.\u2019 This is a pagan ritual, pagan remnants that were seeping into the church. One of them also was \u2018nature worship.\u2019 What is environmentalism but nature worship?\n\n\u201cI would say, contrary to some of the criticism, that this is not communism that has entered the church. It\u2019s, rather, paganism.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right. Far from being a communist, the Pope is something worse: a Pagan.\n\nThis is not the first time the Catholic Church has been accused of Paganism, and with good reason; Christianity grew up in a Pagan context and was not left untouched by it, and after all, the religion Christianity grew out of, Judaism, comes out of a shared background with Canaanite Paganism.\n\nReligious syncretism is almost unavoidable, and the Church accommodated itself to Northern European Paganism as it spread into Europe, becoming changed again in the process.\n\nThese are inescapable historical facts. Martin Luther charged that the Catholic Eucharist was \u201csacrifice\u201d and Catholics have been accused to Goddess worship with Mary substituting for the missing goddesses of polytheism.\n\nThen there are the more obvious Pagan trappings, like the Pope\u2019s title of the Pagan High Priest of Rome, his hat, and of course, more broadly speaking, there is the \u201cJesus fish\u201d which is a Pagan fertility symbol representing the vagina, the dates of Christmas, Easter, and so forth.\n\nAnother question might be to ask whether, as Koprowski insists, environmentalism is not to be distinguished from nature worship, and therefore, Paganism. That is, does Koprowski\u2019s charge hold water?\n\nNot really, and for two reasons. Environmentalism is not nature worship, and Pagans don\u2019t worship nature. Seeing holiness in nature is not the same as worshiping it. Pagan gods are part of this world, as opposed to outside of it, as is the God of the Bible, so it is perhaps natural that Pagans are seen as worshiping trees and rocks and so forth.\n\nChristianity, like Judaism, is, as well as being a religion of the book, a \u201crevealed\u201d religion. Paganism, on the other hand, is not revealed. As historian Clifford Ando writes, \u201cin contrast to the Christians, who had faith, the Romans had knowledge; and\u2026their knowledge was empirical in orientation\u2026the Romans did not need faith; they had an orthopraxy\u201d \u2013 that is, rather than \u201corthodoxy\u201d (correct belief) they had correct practice (orthopraxy).\n\nRather than belief in the absurd, as Kierkegaard described Christianity, Roman Pagans based their focus on ritual on practices that worked. If things did not work, they had either been done incorrectly (an error made, demanding repetition) or the ritual itself was flawed, which demanded, Ando tells us, \u201can alteration in the script.\u201d\n\nThis is a vastly different thing than a Christian believing (as some still do) that God simply did not want, for whatever inscrutable reasons, for you to get what you wanted, or to blame it on sin or wrongdoing that must first be expatiated, but rather on the idea that you had made an error of a much more practical kind.\n\nThe Pope believes that humans must care for the earth, for creation, because yes, creation is from the hands of God, but also because it is what God wants.\n\nThis is a vastly different rationale than that of your garden variety Pagan, who sees her gods and goddess \u2013 the divine \u2013 all around her. The Pope has an outside God demanding something while a Pagan has inside gods and goddesses all around her.\n\nThis is not to say Pagans did not abuse the environment. They did. Pollution at the height of the Roman Empire was not again matched until the Industrial Revolution. The Heathen Vikings denuded Iceland of trees, essentially stranding themselves there without timber or ships from Europe.\n\nAnd these lessons from history are another reason to put a damper on Koprowski\u2019s misguided enthusiasm. The Pope is not Pagan. Nor is the Catholic Church. The Church appropriated things Pagan in the same way that Nazis incorporated things Pagan, repurposing them for their own uses.\n\nHowever much conservatives with the Pope would adhere to their modern, capitalist-centered ideology, Francis is on firm \u2013 if shared \u2013 theological ground when he condemns capitalism\u2019s abuse not only of people, but of the environment.\n\nThe problem for conservatives is really not that the Pope has made room for Paganism in the Church, but rather that he refuses to make room for capitalism and all its attendant abuses.\n\nFurther Reading: Clifford Ando.

Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down.

Police put him in handcuffs and, even after the confusion passed, the boy was suspended from school.\n\nThat earned Mohamed a planned trip to the White House, a message of support from Hillary Clinton, an offer to stop by Facebook to meet Mark Zuckerberg and an invitation to be an intern at Twitter.\n\nThe police overreacted. Yet the device did look like something Ethan Hunt would lob out of a helicopter at the last minute in \u201cMission: Impossible.\u201d As National Review\u2019s Charles Cooke pointed out on Twitter, the scary-looking tangle of wires \u201clooks a lot more like a bomb than a pop tart looks like a gun.\u201d\n\nJosh Welch, a white Maryland kid with ADHD who was 7 years old when he was kicked out of school for chewing a Pop-Tart into the shape of a pistol and pretending to shoot other students with it, must be puzzled.\n\nWhere\u2019s his White House invitation? Where\u2019s his chance to start networking at Facebook? His parents were forced to hire a lawyer and spent a year and a half just trying to get the suspension erased from the kid\u2019s record. They were repeatedly refused.\n\n\u201cI stand with Ahmed, too. But I also stand with Alex Stone,\u201d noted Reason writer Robby Soave. Alex Stone, a 16-year-old white kid from Summerville, SC, wrote a short story in which he imagined using a gun to kill a dinosaur. For this his locker was searched and he was arrested, handcuffed, charged with \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d and suspended from school for three days.\n\nObviously the White House and Mark Zuckerberg couldn\u2019t be bothered to comment, but you\u2019d think that, at the very least, Stephen King would have sent out a tweet expressing outrage that imagination was being punished.\n\nNada.\n\nIn Dyer County, Tenn., Kendra Turner says she was suspended for saying, \u201cBless you\u201d after a student sneezed, and that her teacher told her that she would have no \u201cgodly speaking in class.\u201d\n\nA school administrator said, \u201cThis was not a religious issue at all, but more of an issue the teacher felt was a distraction in her class.\u201d Uh-huh. School leadership offered no explanation for the photos posted by students that showed \u201cbless you\u201d on a list of expressions banned in the classroom. Turner is still waiting for her call from President Obama.\n\nAre white kids being punished en masse for dopey quasi-infractions because of their race? Of course not. That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nBut it\u2019s equally absurd to suggest that you have to be Muslim, or brown-skinned, or live in Texas, to be subjected to overenthusiastic use of school discipline and police force.\n\n\u201cIt never would have happened to a white kid\u201d? It happens to white kids all. The. Time.\n\nThe main difference between the Ahmed Mohamed case and the others is that the mainstream media and the leftist point of view it presents just can\u2019t let go of Ahmed. Ahmed is too useful to their narrative to be a one-day story.\n\nThat Bristol Palin said on Facebook that President Obama didn\u2019t need to get involved in the situation proved irresistible for the media, which loves to depict America as a bitter standoff between red-state hicks on the one hand and sophisticated members of the cool bicoastal techno-media club on the other.\n\nLet\u2019s just savor for a moment that the musings of the daughter of an unemployed former governor constitute national news. This year the brother of a sitting president made derogatory comments about the leader of the free world and the reaction from the media was crickets.\n\nMalik Obama gets the courtesy of being ignored because he has also said some crazy things. Now imagine Bristol Palin making loony statements. Would the media decline to cover them?\n\nFor 14 years and two weeks now, the left has been desperate to find some evidence, any evidence, that Muslims in general are facing deep-seated discrimination because a few Muslims attacked us on 9/11.\n\nThat American Muslims have instead mostly been treated with respect and courtesy ought to be a point of pride, but at no point will the left ever say, \u201cIsn\u2019t it great that we\u2019re such a pluralistic and tolerant country?\u201d\n\nThe left-led push to turn a man who was, as of 2004, an obscure state senator with no particular accomplishments, into the president four years later, was centrally and crucially about race.

Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base.

They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke.

Apparently this follows a pattern of refusals to cooperate that go back as far as the original inspector general investigation back in the early summer.\n\nPagliano had worked with Clinton going back to at least 2006, serving on her original presidential campaign then later at the State Department with continuing duties overseeing the email server. Last week Clinton claimed to have used the secret private email server going back at least to her time as senator from New York:\n\n\u201cI did all my business on my personal email [in the Senate],\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI was not thinking a lot when I got in [to the State Department]. There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world. I didn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be.\u201d \u201cThis was fully above board, people knew I was using a personal email, I did it for convenience. I sent emails that I thought were work related to people\u2019s dot gov accounts,\u201d she added.\n\nThis last statement is a direct contradiction to evidence previously revealed that showed that Clinton and her aides had sent information that would later be determined to be classified to at least six other people\u2019s private email addresses, including non-government employee Sidney Blumenthal, the longtime ClintonWorld loyalist who was blocked from taking a position at State by the Obama Administration due to rumors he had spread about President Obama during the 2008 campaign.\n\nAs the Baltimore Sun said today \u201cThere is a smoking gun.

Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:"], ["http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-deal-will-facilitate-and-accelerate-/", "Ted Cruz says deal will 'facilitate and accelerate' Iran getting a nuclear bomb", "Along with Donald Trump and the Tea Party Patriots, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke out harshly against a nuclear agreement with Iran at the U.S. Capitol. When the rally was over, Cruz followed up by tweeting out video clips of some of his comments.\n\n\"The #IranDeal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons,\" he said in a tweet on Sept. 9, 2015.\n\nHis comment caught our attention. We wondered whether it was accurate that the agreement would actually make it easier -- not harder -- for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhat the deal will do\n\nFirst, let\u2019s recap what the deal would do. Broadly speaking, Iran would agree to accept strict curbs on nuclear technologies and intrusive access by nuclear-weapons inspectors for 10 to 25 years, with a pledge to abide by existing international treaties limiting its nuclear ambitions in perpetuity. In exchange, international economic sanctions against Iran would be lifted, as long as Iran doesn\u2019t cheat. If Iran did cheat, sanctions could be reimposed.\n\nSpecifically, the deal requires Iran to give up 97 percent of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, the kind needed to make nuclear weapons, as well as most of the centrifuges it can use to enrich uranium. In addition, Iran agrees to only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for 15 years, and to cease production of plutonium, the other element that can be used to build a bomb. Known nuclear sites would be monitored for 15 years to confirm compliance, and inspectors would have the ability to enter undeclared sites suspected of nuclear use, though with possible delays of up to 24 days.\n\nIf Iran were to abide by these rules for 10 years, scientists say it would take them at least 12 months to build a weapon.\n\nCruz's case\n\nCruz\u2019s staff did not respond to inquiries for this story, and we could find only one nuclear-policy expert who thought Cruz\u2019s claim may have some merit.\n\nMichaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it depends on whether and when Iran cheats on the deal. \"There\u2019s a some degree of assumption that Iran will cheat in this, which isn\u2019t entirely unreasonable given Iran\u2019s history,\" she said. \"Let\u2019s say Iran abides by the deal just long enough to have sanctions lifted and lucrative contracts signed, and then pulls out, you can make the case\" that Cruz does, she said.\n\nThis might mean Iran sticking with the agreement for two years, then pulling out and pursuing a weapon, Dodge said.\n\nStill, even this scenario -- problematic though it would be geopolitically -- would enable two years of tight international scrutiny of Iran\u2019s nuclear program that would not otherwise exist without the agreement.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if today\u2019s economic sanctions against Iran are expected to live on if the agreement fails to be enacted. Most observers assume that U.S. allies will begin loosening key sanctions whether or not the agreement is implemented.\n\n\"The European Union has already begun the process of suspending its sanctions on Iran, and the U.N. Security Council likewise wasted no time in passing a resolution for sanctions relief, though it delayed implementation for 90 days,\" Suzanne Nossel, a former deputy assistant secretary of state at the U.S. State Department, recently wrote in Foreign Policy. \"While congressional naysayers now trumpet the success of sanctions and demand that they remain in place, experts uniformly affirm that their effectiveness depends on wide multilateral support.\"\n\nObstacles to an Iranian bomb\n\nAll the other nuclear-policy experts we checked with said the deal puts roadblocks in the way of Iran's effort to pursue a nuclear weapon -- roadblocks that wouldn\u2019t exist if the deal simply fell apart. They said that Cruz's statement went too far.\n\n\"The logic is astounding,\" said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. \"Fifteen years of restrictions and upwards of 20 years of enhanced inspections will hardly facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon.\"\n\nMatthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School, agreed, calling Cruz\u2019s logic \"bizarre.\"\n\n\"The terms of the deal require Iran to reduce its installed centrifuges by two-thirds, eliminate almost all of its stock of enriched uranium, modify its Arak reactor to drastically reduce its ability to produce plutonium, and to accept much broader inspections,\" Bunn said. \"Those actions would slow and impede any nuclear weapons effort, not facilitate and accelerate it.\"\n\nThis is not to say that there is no case to be made against the agreement. Opponents have argued that it simply delays by a decade or so Iran\u2019s eventual acquisition of a bomb, or that the United States and its allies should have negotiated stronger protections, or that by agreeing to the deal, the United States is giving its tacit approval to Iran moving toward a bomb after the deal\u2019s strongest provisions expire.\n\nBut compared to letting the deal evaporate, it\u2019s hard to see how enactment of the deal makes it easier for Iran to get a bomb.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCruz said, \"The Iran Deal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThe Iran deal may be less than perfect, but experts say it\u2019s hard to see how implementing the agreement -- rather than doing nothing at all -- would actually \"facilitate and accelerate\" an Iranian nuclear weapon. The worst-case scenario would be that the deal throws up a couple years\u2019 worth of roadblocks that would not exist otherwise.

The often-overlooked redshirt junior responded with career highs in rushing yards and attempts, finishing with 26 carries.\n\n\"Paul's had some pretty darn good games, but what I thought was impressive about Paul was the toughness that he ran with,\" Mora said. \"He carried people on his back, he moved the pile forward, he carried the ball a lot.\"\n\nPerkins was set to receive his 27th carry of the night on the final drive for the Bruins (3-0), but Starks and the UCLA offensive line had the BYU defense in trouble. Starks had already ripped off runs of 31 and 22 yards on consecutive plays, and he scored the winning touchdown two plays later. The final six plays on the drive were all rushes by Perkins and Starks.\n\n\"The difference in the game was Perkins,\" said Cougars coach Bronco Mendenhall, who dropped to 1-6 against top-10 teams. \"I thought he was really difficult to tackle and I thought he was a catalyst for their team. ... I think their running back was just very patient at creating holes and making us miss.\"\n\nTanner Mangum drove the Cougars (2-1) to the Bruins 42-yard line, but his fourth-down pass was intercepted by Myles Jack, allowing the Rose Bowl crowd of 67,612 to finally celebrate.\n\nMangum threw late touchdown passes to rally BYU to victory each of the previous two weeks.\n\nStarks finished with 81 yards, and UCLA rushed for 296 to overcome Rosen's struggles. Rosen had two turnovers in the red zone, as linebacker Harvey Langi had a pick at the 5-yard line to end a promising drive, and safety Kai Nacua came up with an interception in the end zone in the final minute of the second quarter.\n\nAfter going 5 of 15 for 52 yards in the first half, Rosen completed six of his final eight attempts for 54 yards after halftime, with a 19-yard touchdown to Jordan Payton early in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Coming back to throw that slant-and-go to Jordan and put it right on the money . he didn't play well numbers-wise, but when it mattered he showed exactly who he is and that's exciting,\" Mora said.\n\nIt was a performance UCLA coaches expected would happen at some point this season and were glad it did before next week's Pac-12 opener at Arizona.\n\n\"You guys didn't really want to think it was coming, but it was coming,\" Mazzone said. \"We can practice situations until we are blue in the face, but quarterbacks, kids don't grow up until they can go through the experience. It was a great learning experience for him.\"\n\nMangum had already been through those travails, throwing game-winning passes at Nebraska and against Boise State, and mostly outplayed his 18-year-old counterpart in the highly anticipated meeting of freshman quarterbacks.\n\nMangum was 30 of 47 for 244 yards, one touchdown and one interception, and added a reception for 4 yards when he caught his own batted pass in the fourth quarter. Though he was sacked four times, Mangum made several outstanding throws, including his 14-yard touchdown to Mitch Mathews in the third quarter after UCLA tied the game at 10.\n\nAdam Hine rushed for 149 yards and capped BYU's opening drive with a walk-in 7-yard touchdown run. UCLA linebacker Kenny Young was ejected for targeting after leading with his helmet on a sliding Mangum during the possession, and initially refused to leave the field before sprinting to the locker room.\n\nMichael Davis recovered a surprise onside kick, and though that extra possession did not result in points, it set the tone for an aggressive first half by BYU. Langi played on both sides of the ball and finished with eight tackles and two interceptions, and carried the ball twice for 8 yards.\n\nLate in the game, however, Mendenhall sent Trevor Samson out to kick a 32-yard field goal on fourth-and-3 from the Bruins 14-yard line.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

With the state in control, the backers say, loggers could return to forests where endangered species halted work decades ago and miners could regain access to ore outside the Grand Canyon.\n\n\"In the last 30 years, the radical environmental policies of these federal agencies have ground those industries to a halt \u2014 right into the ground \u2014 and almost killed them,\" said state Sen. Al Melvin, a Republican from Tucson, Ariz., and sponsor of the land-takeover measure.\n\nLegal experts say the movement is based on a misreading of federal law and the U.S. Constitution and will almost certainly fail to survive court challenges. Conservation groups and other critics say the takeover would threaten iconic landscapes now protected by federal rules.\n\nStates are ill-prepared to oversee so much land with the roads, recreation areas and management needs that go along with it, those critics say.\n\n\"In an era of apparent fiscal responsibility, why would the state seek billions of dollars of liability and management responsibility to assume ownership over the (25 million) acres or so of parks, forests and public lands in Arizona?\" said Matt Skroch, executive director of the Arizona Wilderness Coalition. \"It is ill-conceived, it is irresponsible and it makes absolutely no sense.\"\n\nUtah Gov. Gary Herbert signed a package of bills Friday that spells out his state's intent to reclaim the land, and members of Utah's congressional delegation have pledged support for the battle in Washington.\n\nIn Arizona, a nearly identical bill passed the state Senate and awaits final action in the House. Lawmakers also are weighing several other proposals that attempt to undercut federal influence in land management. A proposed ballot measure would go even further, declaring the state's sovereignty over its land, air and water.\n\nThe future of the land-takeover bill is not clear. Gov. Jan Brewer \"believes strongly that the federal government needs to live up to its obligations by actively managing federal lands,\" including thinning national forests, said her spokesman, Matthew Benson.\n\nHowever, he added, \"The governor has not questioned the very concept\" of who is best able to oversee public lands.\n\nThe new sagebrush rebellion appears to do just that, attempting to seize most federal lands. That was the goal, ultimately unsuccessful, of the last rebellion in the late 1970s into the 1990s, when Arizona, Nevada and other states passed legislation seeking to take control of federal lands.\n\nWhat rankled those rebels and those behind today's effort is the sheer size of the federal government's land holdings in the West. In Nevada, the government owns 85% of the state's total area, according to a 2004 analysis by the federal General Services Administration. In Utah, the total is 57%; in Arizona, 48%.\n\n\"We know firsthand what it means to have limited access to and control over our natural resources. It is interfering with our Western way of life,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a Republican who was part of the 1980s takeover attempt and who endorsed the latest proposal earlier this month.\n\nWith the support of then-President Ronald Reagan, the 1980s effort, born in Nevada, led to some changes in land management. But the larger movement fizzled, in part because it lost support of many land users, including ranchers and miners, who feared the loss of federal subsidies for grazing rights and mining royalties.\n\nThis time, the movement originated in Utah as an avenue to evict the federal government and raise money for schools, and it has advanced furthest there.\n\n\"We can't wait any longer,\" said Utah Rep. Ken Ivory, a Republican. \"We value these open lands and open spaces, but certainly we're able to manage the multiple use for a sustained yield of natural resources. Utah will show the nation what it means to be self-reliant.\"\n\nIn Arizona, the measure calls for the transfer of lands to the state from the federal government. Melvin brought the bill to Arizona after hearing about it late last year from the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization that often provides state lawmakers with model legislation, written by its own staff.\n\nMelvin said Washington has done a terrible job managing public lands, resulting in damage to industries such as ranching, farming, timber and mining. Melvin and other supporters also blame the federal government for over-regulating Arizona's public lands, leading to overgrown forests that helped fuel last year's Wallow fire, which burned more than 538,000 acres.\n\nPrivate owners hold just 18% of of Arizona's 113,524 square miles with federal, tribal and state lands making up the rest, Melvin said.\n\nUnder local control, Melvin said officials could sell off land or raise revenue from taxes and developmental rights. The revenue could reshape the future of the West, he said.\n\nState Sen. Sylvia Allen, a Republican from Snowflake, Ariz., co-sponsored Arizona's bill because she believes the state has been operating at a disadvantage with the \"layers and layers of bureaucracy\" forced on the state by the federal government.\n\nAllen said she would not sell off much of the public land to the private sector, but she is confident the state could better manage the land. She also believes the bill would allow the state to lift a new ban on uranium mining on 1 million acres of public land outside the Grand Canyon.\n\nLegal experts at the University of Idaho and Arizona State University said the states' demands of the federal government lack legal merit, partly because the states were allowed to join the union on the condition that the federal government would control some land.\n\nRichard Seamon, a law professor at the University of Idaho, said the attempt to seize the land isn't unconstitutional. It just wouldn't work.\n\n\"You can kind of envision it like an act of civil disobedience,\" Seamon said. \"If you really, genuinely believe that the federal government has been disrespecting or violating the states' rights, then there's nothing wrong with the states responding by filing lawsuits or even passing laws that are doomed to fail when they're challenged in the courts.\"\n\nDale Goble, a University of Idaho professor specializing in natural-resources law, agreed.\n\n\"Blasting the feds has been popular since 1787\" when the U.S. Constitution was written, he said. \"The question has been kicked around since the nation's beginning. And every time it's been raised, the answer has always been no.\"\n\nConservation groups say that by opening forests and other public lands to development, lawmakers risk ruining the iconic landscapes that draw visitors and new residents.\n\n\"This legislature would take what's special about Arizona and destroy it,\" said Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon chapter. \"I think most people believe our national forests are there to protect the watershed, provide habitat for wildlife, places for recreation. People come here because it's beautiful, and it's beautiful because we have public lands, not because of the cookie-cutter subdivisions on the outskirts of Phoenix.\"\n\nSkroch of the wilderness coalition said a wholesale takeover of public lands would bankrupt the state as it attempted to maintain thousands of miles of forest roads, campgrounds and infrastructure that federal land agencies built through the years. And it would rob residents of a valuable resource.\n\n\"People love their public lands,\" he said. \"It is a uniquely American idea. The benefits the public lands provide are almost incalculable: the economic benefits from ecotourism, the added quality of life, the environmental value. The idea of transferring those lands and selling them to the highest bidder would be a travesty.\""], ["http://act.credoaction.com/sign/wildfire_funding?sp_ref=150168968.4.15932.t.66050.2&referring_akid=.8176363.P2L2JT&source=tw_sp", "Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act... and make polluters pay for it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to adequately fund response to escalating wildfires, and to stop subsidizing the global warming pollution making fires worse.

Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

But more than that, it\u2019s clearer than ever that these people are jokers.\n\nWell, that was all kind of...interminable. For a time there in the middle, I thought Ben Carson had strolled out to perform some elective surgery. I guess we kind of agree that Carly Fiorina won, since she did manage to convey some real or at least manufactured-real passion on about three or four occasions.\n\nBut you wanna know who really won that debate? Hillary Clinton. Go ahead, go ahead, laugh all you want. Yes, her stock is selling awfully low right now. Nate Silver says, accurately, that she is in a \u201cself-reinforcing funk\u201d right now and that there\u2019s no obvious way out for the time being.\n\nBut consider. She is still the overwhelming favorite to be the Democratic nominee. She still leads the Republicans in a strong majority of the general election head-to-head matchups. And that\u2019s after two horrible media months in which, by Silver\u2019s count, she has endured 29 negative news stories while enjoying just one positive one. All that, and she\u2019s still mostly ahead.\n\nAnd being the Democrat, she has the Electoral College advantage that any plausible Democrat has these days because the GOP has just positioned itself too far right to win states that it regularly won back in the Nixon-to-Bush Sr. era. That advantage is either 257 electoral votes that tilt strongly Democratic, or 247, if you put Iowa and New Hampshire on the fence as, for example, Larry Sabato does. I do not, because those two states have both gone Democratic five of the last six times, which is trend enough for me. The comparable Republican number, the \u201cnatural\u201d Republican Electoral College vote, is 206. If Clinton holds every state that\u2019s gone Democratic in five out of the last six and sneaks by in Virginia, boom, Madam President. She doesn\u2019t even need Ohio or Florida.\n\nAll that speaks to the advantages she still enjoys, even with the quicksand she\u2019s been stuck in lately. But all that isn\u2019t why she won the debate. She won the debate because these people are jokers. Donald Trump, come on. I mean, look: I\u2019ve come to believe here lately that he\u2019d be a better president than most of them in some ways. I could picture the Trump whom Jonah Goldberg detests nominating someone to the Supreme Court who is not a knuckle-dragger. But that doesn\u2019t erase the fundamental and self-evident preposterosity of the idea of President Trump. He slipped Wednesday night. That moment when he said he\u2019d know plenty about foreign policy in good time was embarrassing.\n\nBen Carson. Yes, he seems like a nice enough man. But he had nothing interesting to say. Carly Fiorina had good lines. She\u2019s well prepped for these things. But if she actually did call \u201cthe supreme leader\u201d\u2014did you notice how she called him that, just like the quisling Obama does?\u2014on her first day in office and change the terms of the Iran deal as radically as she suggested, Tehran would have a nuclear weapon in about four months. She was also well prepped on her Hewlett-Packard tenure, how to answer the disaster charge (she walked away with a $40 million parachute, by the way). But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it was bad, and not just because of the economy. Her Compaq decision, among others, had a lot to do with it. If we\u2019re sizing up business people, she is less qualified than Trump.\n\nAs for the \u201cserious\u201d ones, Jeb Bush and the others, they are in their way even worse. Unlike the outsider triumvirate, they know actual facts about governmental policy, and yet they still persist in uttering this fantasy gibberish to assuage the hard right base. It\u2019s one thing for Trump to say he can bully the Ford Motor Company in one day to keep a plant in Michigan. He probably truly believes he could. But it\u2019s quite another for Bush to say his brother \u201ckept America safe.\u201d Yes, he did. Except for 9/11. Well, whatever. And what were those brainwashed idiots doing applauding that line? This is the kind of thing that only conservatives believe, because it\u2019s just obviously not true, and everyone else knows it.\n\nThere were a few moments of quasi-reality. Rand Paul and John Kasich were sort of interesting on foreign policy, which we can assume hurt them badly. But basically, the whole thing was ridiculous. The jokers are ahead, and they haven\u2019t offered a serious proposal among them. The allegedly serious ones are mostly just doing what Mitt Romney did, to his peril, in 2012, jumping up in front of the base saying, \u201cSee, I can be crazy right-wing, too!\u201d\n\nIn 2016, they\u2019ll say we can\u2019t believe we lost to such a corrupt blah-da-de-blah, and the answer will be the same as it was then: You people aren\u2019t in the real world where most Americans live.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton has offered serious policy proposals one after the other. No Republican even comes remotely close, with the partial exception of Paul, who has been rewarded for his quasi-seriousness with what, 3 percent support. Compare, for example, Clinton\u2019s tax proposal to Bush\u2019s. Yes, they both want to end the carried-interest loophole for hedge-fund managers, which is the headline.\n\nBut look beyond the headline. In a July 12 speech, Clinton paired that announcement with a series of other steps that would do what eliminating the carried-interest loophole is designed to do: try to alleviate inequality. Bush, in contrast, tossed elimination of the loophole in there as a look-good sop in a package of tax proposals that otherwise will exacerbate inequality and continue the party for the 1 percent that his brother so diligently advanced.\n\nI could go on, and on. But suffice it to say: Clinton is putting forward policy after policy that address America\u2019s great problems. These people are just making stuff up. Eventually, issues will matter. And voters will see what they saw in 2008 and 2012, two elections when Republicans couldn\u2019t believe they lost to such a lightweight. In 2016, they\u2019ll say we can\u2019t believe we lost to such a corrupt blah-da-de-blah, and the answer will be the same as it was then: You people aren\u2019t in the real world where most Americans live.\n\nThe best line of the night? Rick Santorum, at the JV debate. When he said his party is all about business owners but won\u2019t talk to workers.

No deals, no compromises and no cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\"\n\nCongress is back from recess and the fight to defund Planned Parenthood is back with them.\n\nIn August, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood failed in the Senate. Any bill like it will fail again \u2014 Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nBut what right-wing congressional Republican leadership does have, in seemingly endless supply, is the great desire to grandstand for their extremist base. Since they can\u2019t pass a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans are now threatening to shut down the government if Democrats don\u2019t agree to a budget that cuts Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat\u2019s where congressional Democrats come in. While there are many champions of women\u2019s rights who would never back down in their defense of Planned Parenthood, there are others who may be willing to compromise with Republican hostage takers in order to get a budget passed. We have to make sure they hold the line.\n\nNow is the time for Democrats to be all in for women. Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been clear that it\u2019s a terrible idea that he\u2019ll try to block.1 But that doesn\u2019t mean his fellow Republicans, especially the ones running for president in 2016, won\u2019t stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis fight is not just about Republicans trying to take away women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care. They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke. We need to make sure our support is just as strong now.\n\nTell congressional Democrats: I\u2019m counting on you to stand with me in support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThanks for joining us in standing with Planned Parenthood.\n\nReferences:"], ["http://www.chieftain.com/opinion/letters/3920381-120/iran-believe-peace-war", "Letter: Choosing diplomacy over war", "Sen.

He has stood up to the Israeli lobby, which advocates the pre-emptive bombing of Iran; he has resisted the big-moneyed influence of the arms merchants who profit from never-ending wars; he has rejected the misguided zealots who adhere more fervently to the visions of John than to the gospel of Christ.\n\nIf a few more elected officials come to their senses, perhaps the suicide pact between apocalyptic Islamic and Christian fanatics can be broken. Perhaps this can be the beginning of a joint effort by the peace-loving peoples of Iran and America.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., also will stop listening to the religious fanatics, Israeli hawks and greedy arms merchants. Let\u2019s hope that he also will vote to halt the insane march to Armageddon.

A group of so-called moderate Democrats sought to block the passage of SB 350. This landmark climate bill would do three things: increase California\u2019s building energy efficiency 50 percent by 2030, an excellent idea not drawing serious opposition; increase California\u2019s use of renewable fuels 50 percent by 2030, an excellent idea drawing strong support from the cleantech industry, building trades, and many more; and cut petroleum use 50 percent by 2030, a most excellent idea cutting into the profits of Chevron and Occidental and OMG THE SKY IS FALLING WE ARE DOOOOMED THEY\u2019RE COMING FOR YOUR MINIVAN, warn the deceptive mailers.\n\nWho are these moderate Democrats? The cynical among us might call them \u201ccorporate Democrats\u201d or \u201coil-drenched Democrats.\u201d Dan Morain at the Sacramento Bee explains:\n\nAs near as I can tell, being a moderate has little to do with their stands on social issues, or their willingness to challenge the core of Democratic support, public employee unions; they aren\u2019t. Rather, the definition seems to revolve around a willingness to accept campaign money from oil, tobacco or anyone else, and their malleability when donors come calling.\n\nI was one of throngs roaming the Capitol during the pressure cooker last week of session. Because no one knew my face, I was able to photograph a Chevron lobbyist writing a thank-you note to an Assemblymember immediately after the Assembly voted against the related SB 32 (the bill failed that vote, barely survived a second vote, and is now on the shelf til next year).\n\nAnd when I stepped outside into the 108 degree weather, if the winds were right, I could pick up the smoke and the haze of the Rough fire, burning Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks far to the south. It\u2019s been raging since July 31 and has burned nearly 140K acres over the last few weeks.\n\nA so-called Democrat, Adam Gray (D-Merced), demanded that $550M/year be diverted from a $2.5B/year cap and trade fund for greenhouse gas emissions reduction to instead go to building dams. But it hasn\u2019t rained in California in four years, this year\u2019s snowpack is the smallest in 500 years, and empty dams make illusory promises.\n\nAs the chair of the Cal Dem Party\u2019s environmental caucus, I tried circulating a pledge among party delegates that they would do what they could to block the party endorsement for any Assemblymember voting against SB 350. Word filtered up to party leaders Tuesday night, and the next thing that I knew, the Sacramento Bee stated:\n\nOutgoing Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins of San Diego, where the ocean breeze cleanses the air, let her house off easy by failing to put SB 350 to a vote. That indecision gave the bill\u2019s opponents the cover of not having to cast votes that would have defined them as siding with the oil industry.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown and Senate Pro Tem Kevin DeLeon did the only thing they could in the face of a co-leader who refused to let SB 350 come up for a vote: Wednesday afternoon they pulled the petroleum reduction section from the bill.\n\nThe same day, the Butte fire began in Amador and Calaveras counties east of the Capitol. It\u2019s burned 60,000 acres and destroyed 166 homes so far.\n\nWith the petroleum reduction section removed, Big Oil withdrew its opposition to SB 350, and the bill passed easily on Friday night. Lots of Democrats gave happy speeches on how they were doing something about climate change. Toasts were made and everyone who could left the Capitol for cooler climates.\n\nThen the Valley fire flared up in Lake County, north and west of the Capitol. At least one person who couldn\u2019t get out of her home has died. 585 homes have been destroyed.\n\nI left the Capitol with the taste of ashes in my mouth.\n\nTo state the REALLY FUCKING OBVIOUS, a hotter, drier changed climate is a factor in hotter, bigger wildfires.\n\nI successfully ran for chair of the Cal Dem Party\u2019s environmental caucus a few years ago for the same reason that I started up Climate Hawks Vote: to build grassroots political power for the climate movement. This legislative session has made me question whether I can share the label \u201cDemocrat\u201d with those who would burn California for the sake of Chevron campaign contributions.

But corporations already owe that money anyway \u2013 at the full 35% corporate tax rate. Letting multinationals bring money back at 14% or lower would be rewarding companies for dodging taxes for years.5\n\nNot only would the proposal result in a massive one-time giveaway, it would create a permanent \u201cterritorial\u201d tax system that taxes profits earned overseas at a lower rate. Companies that actually do business here in the U.S. would be at a permanent disadvantage to multinationals who can dispatch a team of lawyers and financial wizards to pretend that profits from selling to U.S. customers were actually earned elsewhere. Putting local businesses at a disadvantage and creating a new incentive for companies to outsource jobs makes no sense, especially in order to fund funding job-creating infrastructure.6\n\nThe bipartisan proposal by Sens.

If you are Islamic ... it's hard to believe, you can come in so easily,\" Trump said in a speech in Las Vegas on July 11, 2015. \"In fact, it's one of our main groups of people that are coming in. Now, not that we should discriminate against one or the other, but if you are Christian, you cannot get into the country. You cannot get into the country.\"\n\nTrump has made similar arguments before, such as in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in June. So we decided to see if Trump\u2019s claim was accurate. Neither Trump nor the White House responded to an inquiry, but we did communicate with representatives of a range of refugee-assistance groups and scholars who study the issue.\n\nThe most that can be said for Trump\u2019s claim is that there is a sizable difference between the number of Muslims and the number of Christians that have come into the United States as refugees so far.\n\nBetween Oct. 1, 2014, and July 17, 2015, according to federal data , 859 Sunni Muslims, five Shiite Muslims and 42 people identified only as \"Muslim\" arrived in the United States as refugees from Syria, for a total of 906. Meanwhile, 28 Christians arrived from Syria. (Other arrivals included two atheists, two of the Baha'i faith and one with no stated religion.)\n\nSo, on its face, Trump\u2019s claim that you \"cannot come into this country\" if you\u2019re a Christian from Syria is wrong.\n\nStill, this data finds that 96 percent of the refugee arrivals from Syria were Muslim, compared to only about 3 percent who were Christian. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the population of Syria is overwhelmingly Muslim to start with. The CIA World Fact Book says Syria\u2019s population is 87 percent Muslim and 10 percent Christian.\n\nIn other words, the refugee numbers are a bit more heavily Muslim and a bit less Christian than the population at large, but not dramatically so.\n\n\"While there may be higher numbers of Muslims from Syria who have come to the U.S. than Christians, this is not reflective of any policy making it easier for Muslims and harder for Christians,\" said Shaina Ward, associate director of Refugee Council USA.\n\nWard noted that the the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees does most of the initial screening of refugees seeking resettlement. UNHCR, she said, \"identifies and refers the most vulnerable, whoever they are,\" using a variety of criteria in addition to religion\n\nMore importantly, there is no evidence whatsoever for the most explosive element of Trump\u2019s charge -- that the U.S. government is discriminating against Christians as a matter of official policy.\n\n\"The U.S. refugee resettlement program is open to Muslims and Christians, as well as to members of other targeted religious groups,\" said Jennifer Moore, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.\n\nKaren Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, agreed, calling Trump\u2019s charge \"completely untrue.\"\n\n\"The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims,\" Jacobsen said.\n\nRepresentatives of three human-rights groups we contacted -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Refugee Council USA -- also agreed that Trump\u2019s accusation is off-base.\n\nGeoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, agreed, adding that he has \"worked with Christians from Egypt and Syria, so I know they are getting in.\"\n\nSome experts argued that the biggest problem with the refugee flow from Syria is not that it\u2019s discriminatory against Christians, but that the trickle has been so small.\n\nIn September 2014 , the State Department wrote that \"the refugee crisis caused by the conflict in Syria is the worst the world has witnessed in a generation, with more than 2.9 million refugees in the region. More than 9 million people need assistance, including 6.5 million displaced inside Syria.\"\n\nYet the U.S. government, as noted before, has let in a tiny fraction of those numbers -- less than 1,000 in the past nine months, and only about 2,500 prior to August 2014.\n\nOne reason for the small number of admittances is the long process facing refugees. Once a case is referred from the UNHCR to the United States, a refugee must undergo a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, \"cultural orientation\" classes, and one final security clearance. The background checks are often particularly complicated for refugees who were forced to flee their homes without the opportunity to gather important paperwork.\n\nGiven these requirements, Susan Martin, a professor of international migration at Georgetown University, takes issue with the claim by Trump that if you\u2019re a Muslim, \"you can come in so easily.\"\n\n\"I know from my own research and the literature on resettlement that no one comes in 'easily,\u2019 \" she said. \"The security checks are very comprehensive and very time consuming. When I was looking at resettlement of Iraqi refugees in Jordan a few years ago, I met with a number of families who had been approved for admission to the United States by the Department of Homeland Security but were awaiting their security checks. Most had been waiting for months, including families with young children who were in need of specialized medical care. I don't think any of them would have characterized the process as easy.\u2019 \"\n\nA final note: There is one step that the U.S. government could take if it wished. It could give Christian refugees from Syria a leg up on resettlement by granting them status as a \"priority 2\" or \"P-2\" class -- \"groups of special humanitarian concern identified by the U.S. refugee program,\" according to the government .\n\nP-2 groups have long included Jews, evangelical Christians, and Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox religious adherents from what used to be the Soviet Union, as well as dissidents from Cuba and a variety of religious minorities in Iran. It also included Vietnamese refugees until 2009 and Bosnian refugees during the 1990s-era civil war. It now includes Iraqis who helped United States military or diplomatic efforts after the Iraq War, as well as certain Burmese, Bhutanese and Congolese refugees.\n\nSo far, no group from Syria, Christians or otherwise, has been granted this status.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said that \"if you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country\" as a refugee. This is wrong on its face -- a small number of Syrian Christians been admitted as refugees over the past nine months -- and also false in spirit, since there is nothing in the United States\u2019 laws or regulations that discriminates against Christian refugees.

Yet, about 60 percent of associates, bachelors and masters degrees granted in the United States are to women.\n\nMinorities have propagated the notions that they are permanently disadvantaged by past wrongs and have won perpetual preferences in university admissions and hiring.\n\nTo young men at the margins with slim prospects for a decent education or rewarding job, the constant drumbeat of those ideologies and the disadvantages their remedies impose on them become a direct assault on their futures and self-worth, and too often manifest in destructive and violent responses.\n\nIntellectuals on the left have long wedded the grievances of radical feminists and minorities with an unrelenting propaganda assault against private enterprise, capitalism and U.S. foreign policy, and elected politicians like Mr. Obama to effect radical change.\n\nAt every opportunity, Mr. Obama appeals to the radical left, promising to redress injustices\u2014even those long dead\u2014and apologizes for western and American misdeeds.\n\nAt a recent National Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Obama said:\n\n\u201cLest we get on our high horse and think this [violence in the name of religion] is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.\u201d\n\nWords like those may help the president energize support among university professors and the liberal media\u2014and the millions who believe their opinions are scriptural truth\u2014but those words provide ammunition to terrorist recruiters preying on disaffected and potentially violent youth.\n\nOur governments and civilization cannot compete for their allegiance if our leaders are constantly pandering to false notions about the West\u2019s guilt and culpability for all the misdeeds of humanity.\n\nFrance has implemented massive surveillance to identify and track recruits to jihadist terrorism and radical Islamism.

If you are Islamic ... it's hard to believe, you can come in so easily,\" Trump said in a speech in Las Vegas on July 11, 2015. \"In fact, it's one of our main groups of people that are coming in. Now, not that we should discriminate against one or the other, but if you are Christian, you cannot get into the country. You cannot get into the country.\"\n\nTrump has made similar arguments before, such as in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in June. So we decided to see if Trump\u2019s claim was accurate. Neither Trump nor the White House responded to an inquiry, but we did communicate with representatives of a range of refugee-assistance groups and scholars who study the issue.\n\nThe most that can be said for Trump\u2019s claim is that there is a sizable difference between the number of Muslims and the number of Christians that have come into the United States as refugees so far.\n\nBetween Oct. 1, 2014, and July 17, 2015, according to federal data , 859 Sunni Muslims, five Shiite Muslims and 42 people identified only as \"Muslim\" arrived in the United States as refugees from Syria, for a total of 906. Meanwhile, 28 Christians arrived from Syria. (Other arrivals included two atheists, two of the Baha'i faith and one with no stated religion.)\n\nSo, on its face, Trump\u2019s claim that you \"cannot come into this country\" if you\u2019re a Christian from Syria is wrong.\n\nStill, this data finds that 96 percent of the refugee arrivals from Syria were Muslim, compared to only about 3 percent who were Christian. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the population of Syria is overwhelmingly Muslim to start with. The CIA World Fact Book says Syria\u2019s population is 87 percent Muslim and 10 percent Christian.\n\nIn other words, the refugee numbers are a bit more heavily Muslim and a bit less Christian than the population at large, but not dramatically so.\n\n\"While there may be higher numbers of Muslims from Syria who have come to the U.S. than Christians, this is not reflective of any policy making it easier for Muslims and harder for Christians,\" said Shaina Ward, associate director of Refugee Council USA.\n\nWard noted that the the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees does most of the initial screening of refugees seeking resettlement. UNHCR, she said, \"identifies and refers the most vulnerable, whoever they are,\" using a variety of criteria in addition to religion\n\nMore importantly, there is no evidence whatsoever for the most explosive element of Trump\u2019s charge -- that the U.S. government is discriminating against Christians as a matter of official policy.\n\n\"The U.S. refugee resettlement program is open to Muslims and Christians, as well as to members of other targeted religious groups,\" said Jennifer Moore, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.\n\nKaren Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, agreed, calling Trump\u2019s charge \"completely untrue.\"\n\n\"The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims,\" Jacobsen said.\n\nRepresentatives of three human-rights groups we contacted -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Refugee Council USA -- also agreed that Trump\u2019s accusation is off-base.\n\nGeoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, agreed, adding that he has \"worked with Christians from Egypt and Syria, so I know they are getting in.\"\n\nSome experts argued that the biggest problem with the refugee flow from Syria is not that it\u2019s discriminatory against Christians, but that the trickle has been so small.\n\nIn September 2014 , the State Department wrote that \"the refugee crisis caused by the conflict in Syria is the worst the world has witnessed in a generation, with more than 2.9 million refugees in the region. More than 9 million people need assistance, including 6.5 million displaced inside Syria.\"\n\nYet the U.S. government, as noted before, has let in a tiny fraction of those numbers -- less than 1,000 in the past nine months, and only about 2,500 prior to August 2014.\n\nOne reason for the small number of admittances is the long process facing refugees. Once a case is referred from the UNHCR to the United States, a refugee must undergo a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, \"cultural orientation\" classes, and one final security clearance. The background checks are often particularly complicated for refugees who were forced to flee their homes without the opportunity to gather important paperwork.\n\nGiven these requirements, Susan Martin, a professor of international migration at Georgetown University, takes issue with the claim by Trump that if you\u2019re a Muslim, \"you can come in so easily.\"\n\n\"I know from my own research and the literature on resettlement that no one comes in 'easily,\u2019 \" she said. \"The security checks are very comprehensive and very time consuming. When I was looking at resettlement of Iraqi refugees in Jordan a few years ago, I met with a number of families who had been approved for admission to the United States by the Department of Homeland Security but were awaiting their security checks. Most had been waiting for months, including families with young children who were in need of specialized medical care. I don't think any of them would have characterized the process as easy.\u2019 \"\n\nA final note: There is one step that the U.S. government could take if it wished. It could give Christian refugees from Syria a leg up on resettlement by granting them status as a \"priority 2\" or \"P-2\" class -- \"groups of special humanitarian concern identified by the U.S. refugee program,\" according to the government .\n\nP-2 groups have long included Jews, evangelical Christians, and Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox religious adherents from what used to be the Soviet Union, as well as dissidents from Cuba and a variety of religious minorities in Iran. It also included Vietnamese refugees until 2009 and Bosnian refugees during the 1990s-era civil war. It now includes Iraqis who helped United States military or diplomatic efforts after the Iraq War, as well as certain Burmese, Bhutanese and Congolese refugees.\n\nSo far, no group from Syria, Christians or otherwise, has been granted this status.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said that \"if you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country\" as a refugee. This is wrong on its face -- a small number of Syrian Christians been admitted as refugees over the past nine months -- and also false in spirit, since there is nothing in the United States\u2019 laws or regulations that discriminates against Christian refugees.

Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

He received his PhD from the University of London, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, a recipient of a Max Planck Society Visiting Fellowship, and a founding editor the journal Molecular Simulation. (h/t Climate Depot)\n\nProfessor Woodcock told the Yorkshire Evening Post:\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018climate change\u2019 is meaningless. The Earth\u2019s climate has been changing since time immemorial, that is since the Earth was formed 1,000 million years ago. The theory of \u2018man-made climate change\u2019 is an unsubstantiated hypothesis [about] our climate [which says it] has been adversely affected by the burning of fossil fuels in the last 100 years, causing the average temperature on the earth\u2019s surface to increase very slightly but with disastrous environmental consequences.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that the CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuel is the \u2018greenhouse gas\u2019 causes \u2018global warming\u2019 \u2013 in fact, water is a much more powerful greenhouse gas and there is 20 time more of it in our atmosphere (around one per cent of the atmosphere) whereas CO2 is only 0.04 per cent.\n\n\u201cThere is no reproducible scientific evidence CO2 has significantly increased in the last 100 years.\u201d\n\nHe also said:\n\n\u201cEven the term \u2018global warming\u2019 does not mean anything unless you give it a time scale. The temperature of the earth has been going up and down for millions of years, if there are extremes, it\u2019s nothing to do with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it\u2019s not permanent and it\u2019s not caused by us. Global warming is nonsense.\u201d\n\nProfessor Woodcock dismissed evidence for global warming, such as the floods that deluged large parts of Britain this winter, as \u201canecdotal\u201d and therefore meaningless in science.\n\n\u201cEvents can happen with frequencies on all time scales in the physics of a chaotic system such as the weather. Any point on lowland can flood up to a certain level on all time scales from one month to millions of years and it\u2019s completely unpredictable beyond around five days.\u201d\n\nAlso, the only reason we regularly hear that we have had the most extreme weather \u201csince records began\u201d is that records only began about 100 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe reason records seem to be being frequently broken is simply because we only started keeping them about 100 years ago. There will always be some record broken somewhere when we have another natural fluctuation in weather.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely stupid to blame floods on climate change, as I read the Prime Minister did recently. I don\u2019t blame the politicians in this case, however, I blame his so-called scientific advisors.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how can say this when most of the world\u2019s scientists, political leaders and people in general are committed to the theory of global warming, Prof Woodcock answered bluntly:\n\n\u201cThis is not the way science works. If you tell me that you have a theory there is a teapot in orbit between the earth and the moon, it\u2019s not up to me to prove it does not exist, it\u2019s up to you to provide the reproducible scientific evidence for your theory.\n\n\u201cSuch evidence for the man-made climate change theory has not been forthcoming.\u201d\n\nThis lack of evidence has not stopped a whole green industry building up, however. At the behest of that industry, governments have been passing ever more regulations that make life more difficult and expensive.\n\n\u201c\u2026the damage to our economy the climate change lobby is now costing us is infinitely more destructive to the livelihoods of our grand-children. Indeed, we grand-parents are finding it increasingly expensive just to keep warm as a consequence of the idiotic decisions our politicians have taken in recent years about the green production of electricity.\u201d\n\nProfessor Woodcock is the latest scientist to come out against the theory of man-made global warming. James Lovelock, once described as a \u201cgreen guru\u201d, earlier this month said that climate scientists \u201cjust guess\u201d, and that no one really knows what\u2019s happening.\n\nJudith Curry, chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, also said that she was \u201cduped into supporting the IPCC\u201d and added \u201cIf the IPCC is dogma, then count me in as a heretic.\u201d"], ["http://my.democrats.org/page/s/defend-planned-parenthood?utm_source=dnc&utm_medium=facebook&source=fb_dnc_20150918", "Defend Planned Parenthood", "Fight Back Against GOP Attacks on Women's Health\n\nHouse Republicans just voted to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nSay you'll fight back against these unacceptable attacks on women's health."], ["http://act.credoaction.com/sign/PP_Hold_the_Line/?source=tw1", "Democrats can\u2019t compromise when it comes to Planned Parenthood", "\"Democrats in Congress must stand strong against any Republican attacks on women.

We assume we know what the pope means \u2014 that the global Catholic Church now adheres to the same \u201cone strike and you\u2019re out\u201d policy that, at least in theory, has bound all US bishops since 2002.\n\nContinue reading below\n\nThat rule says that clergy guilty of \u201ceven a single act\u201d of sexual abuse will be \u201cremoved permanently\u201d from ministry.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t what the pope is saying. The troubling fact is that zero tolerance still is not compulsory in the global Catholic Church. It exists in the United States only because of the public outrage that engulfed American bishops in 2002, following revelations that they had kept child molesters in ministry. They obtained special permission from the Vatican to adopt a tougher measure.\n\nOutside the United States, however, bishops follow the church\u2019s universal law, which gives them \u2014 and guilty clerics \u2014 plenty of wiggle room. Priests who molest minors are to receive \u201cjust penalties,\u201d which can be as mild as a warning.\n\nPermanent removal is reserved only for certain cases, which the Vatican described in a policy framework sent to the world\u2019s bishops in 2011. A priest must be removed permanently if his ministry would be \u201ca danger for minors or a cause of scandal.\u201d\n\nThis guideline sounds like zero tolerance, but it\u2019s not. It allows a bishop to retain a guilty priest if he or the Vatican decides that the priest has reformed and will not trigger negative publicity.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s continued laxness toward abusive priests is playing out tragically around the world today \u2014 especially in countries with weak reporting laws. That\u2019s because another church law helps the priest\u2019s identity stay secret: Church officials need not report child abuse unless local secular law requires it.\n\nThe result is that Catholic officials in many countries still give second chances to child molesters, with the Vatican\u2019s permission.\n\nIn Argentina, Francis\u2019 homeland, Catholic bishops are bound by neither zero tolerance nor, in most cases, mandatory reporting laws. In our recent research, we easily located several publicly accused priests still in ministry in Argentina, including a priest in the La Plata archdiocese who has been accused by more than 15 victims in the past two years.\n\nSimilarly, in researching the Philippine Catholic Church, we found several examples of Filipino bishops retaining priests who are barred from ministry by US bishops. One, a priest criminally convicted of sexual misconduct with a minor in Detroit, was recently a featured preacher at prayer gatherings that included young people. His bishop defended the priest\u2019s ministry to an American reporter: \u201cWhat obstacle can there be if he has already served his punishment or penalty?\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Cardinal Antonio Luis Tagle, the popular Manila archbishop who is close to Pope Francis, admitted that zero tolerance was \u201cstill being debated\u201d among his fellow bishops. \u201cWe\u2019ve had cases in the past . . . in which some priests who had offended were given a second chance and turned out to be very good priests,\u201d Tagle said.\n\nClearly, when an institution as powerful and ubiquitous as the Catholic Church has an official policy of retaining child molesters under certain circumstances, we must keep working for change.\n\nAt minimum, Pope Francis must enact real zero tolerance. His reform should correct the grave flaws of the US church\u2019s version \u2014 weaknesses demonstrated by recent clergy abuse cases in Newark, Kansas City, Mo., and the Twin Cities. But even a weak version of zero tolerance makes children safer. The rule has \u201cmade it harder for bishops to find excuses to keep a wayward priest in ministry,\u201d observed Nicholas Cafardi, a canon and civil lawyer who chaired the US bishops\u2019 National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Youth.\n\nWe also should exhort Pope Francis\u2019 most trusted adviser on the abuse crisis, Boston\u2019s Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, to advocate for a zero tolerance law. He heads the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which is charged with recommending best practices for responding to abuse.\n\nIn the meantime, this otherwise forthright pope should acknowledge the gap between his promise and his policy. \u201cThere is absolutely no place in ministry for those who abuse minors,\u201d he said this February. Until church law is changed, this is not true.\n\nAnne Barrett Doyle is codirector of BishopAccountability.org, which researches and documents the abuse crisis in the Catholic Church."], ["http://www.cruxnow.com/life/2015/09/19/closing-arguments-slated-in-priests-sexual-tourism-trial/", "Closing arguments slated in priest\u2019s sexual tourism trial", "\uf0e0 E-mail this story \uf00d Your e-mail address Send to an e-mail address (sorry, just one at a time) Message\n\nJOHNSTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Closing arguments are scheduled Monday in the trial of a Roman Catholic priest from western Pennsylvania charged with traveling to Honduras to molest poor street children during missionary trips.\n\nDefense attorneys rested their case in Cambria County Court on Friday afternoon without calling the Rev.

Apparently this follows a pattern of refusals to cooperate that go back as far as the original inspector general investigation back in the early summer.\n\nPagliano had worked with Clinton going back to at least 2006, serving on her original presidential campaign then later at the State Department with continuing duties overseeing the email server. Last week Clinton claimed to have used the secret private email server going back at least to her time as senator from New York:\n\n\u201cI did all my business on my personal email [in the Senate],\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI was not thinking a lot when I got in [to the State Department].

She had nothing to do with the dispute and was an innocent bystander\u2014a victim, even. When the police showed up, both men were already in the front yard and it appeared that the dispute was settled. This should've been case closed, but it wasn't.\n\nOn February 16, 2014, Yvette Smith, a 47-year-old mother beloved by her family and community, was shot twice by an AR-15 assault rifle and killed on the spot by local police as she opened the front door of her home. A full 18 months later, as her case finally came before a jury, it's disturbingly clear that the police lied, repeatedly, in an attempt to cover up their murder of Smith.\n\nYvette Smith Shooting - First Police Statement by hsiehnation\n\nAs you may have seen, police not only claimed that Smith emerged from the home with a firearm, they stated that she ignored police commands. In essence, Smith came out of that house, according to police, ready to bring hellfire and damnation on police and they acted out in self-defense from an incredibly dangerous woman.\n\nThis is a lie. A complete fabrication. When Sheriff Terry Pickering issued the statement, he was fully and completely aware that Yvette Smith wasn't armed. No weapon was found on or near her. He knew this. The officers on the scene knew this, but Sheriff Pickering issued that statement anyway. It sounded better.\n\nKnowing that the evidence and scores of eyewitnesses saw that she was unarmed, police later retracted the statement, but have given absolutely no answers or held anyone responsible for the earlier lie\u2014which was the primary reason given for shooting Smith in the first place.\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but the lies get worse\u2014much worse.\n\nAs you saw in the initial statement released by police, they claimed that Smith ignored their commands. On September 17, in open court, we learned that this was also an elaborate lie told to justify police misconduct.\n\n\n\nDeputy Scott Gaskamp, who arrived at the scene just moments before the shooting, had told investigators and written reports stating that they had ordered Smith to show them her hands, to open the door and come out of the house, Gaskamp testified Thursday. Recordings of the incident showed no commands were ever issued.\n\nGaskamp told the court he never amended any of his reports or came forward to investigators to correct his errors. After reviewing the dashboard camera footage caught from his patrol vehicle and Willis\u2019 vehicle, he realized his written reports were wrong and that he had never told Smith to put her hands up or issued any other command. \u201cI did not say those words. It must have been a figment of my imagination,\u201d Gaskamp said.\n\nWhen pressed to explain this in court, Officer Gaskamp literally admitted that he made the whole damn thing up. He also stated that he couldn't remember telling this lie to the lead investigator, until they played him the recorded interview where he stated the lie over and over again.Are you tracking this? Let me summarize it for you . . .\n\nYvette Smith called 911 for help.\n\nShe opened the front door of her home and was almost instantly shot twice by police with an AR-15 assault rifle.\n\nThe officers on the scene lied and said she was armed.\n\nThe supervising officer doubled down on the lie and spread it in a press release.\n\nThe officers then lied and said they made multiple commands that Smith ignored, but the dashcam footage shows that none of those commands were made. Not one of them.\n\nThe coverup continued . . .\n\n\n\nA few weeks after the shooting, an investigation by BCSO revealed that several supervisors had modified Willis\u2019 field training records after the shooting in an effort to make sure the records were completed accurately. A lieutenant and a sergeant were demoted to patrol deputy and five additional supervisors also faced disciplinary action because of the record changes.\n\nBefore working for Bastrop County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Willis, 29, was employed by Travis County. A Travis County 2012 evaluation of Willis stated that Willis needed more development in handling explosive situations and in the utilization of common sense.\n\nLastly, and this may be the most disturbing fact of all, it was discovered that the officer who shot and killed Smith was found incompetent by another police department.Yes, you read that correctly: The damn evaluation said the police officer who killed Yvette Smith struggled with \"common sense,\" but was hired by a neighboring department anyway.\n\nWhile Officer Willis has been charged in Smith's death, it is increasingly clear that the entire Bastrop County Sheriff's Office conspired to protect one another and cover up this crime. All of them should be immediately fired and a statewide investigation needs to be launched into the corrupt actions that we can clearly see in the murder of Yvette Smith.\n\n"], ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/st-louis-feds-bullard-argued-against-fomc-decision-at-fed-meeting-1442691410?mod=rss_Politics_And_Policy&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "St. Louis Fed\u2019s Bullard Argued Against FOMC Decision at Fed Meeting", "NASHVILLE, Tenn.\u2014Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Saturday he argued against holding rates steady during the Fed\u2019s policy meeting last week because he believes the economy has recovered enough to begin raising rates.\n\n\u201cI would have dissented,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case for policy normalization is quite strong since the committee\u2019s objectives have essentially been met.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do the committee\u2019s policy..."], ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-williams-sees-interest-rate-rise-as-next-appropriate-step-likely-in-2015-1442684288?mod=rss_Politics_And_Policy&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Fed\u2019s Williams Sees 2015 Interest Rate Rise as \u2018Appropriate\u2019", "ARMONK, N.Y.\u2014John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech Saturday he believes it is still appropriate to raise short-term interest rates before year-end, reiterating a timeline that remains the preference of a majority of Fed officials.\n\nIn a speech in Armonk, N.Y., at a symposium on China and the financial system, Mr. Williams said there are \u201carguments on the side of the ledger arguing for more patience.\u201d But he said, \u201cGiven the progress we\u2019ve made and continue to make on our..."], ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-appoints-eric-fanning-as-first-openly-gay-u-s-army-secretary-1442613600?mod=rss_Politics_And_Policy&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Obama Appoints Eric Fanning as First Openly Gay U.S. Army Secretary", "WASHINGTON\u2014U.

The other twenty-four chapters, if passed as they are, will have serious impacts on your livelihoods as workers and consumers, as well as your air, water, food, and medicines\n\nThe reason I call President Obama \u201cKing Obama\u201d in this case is that he, and his massive corporate lobbies (royal court), have sought to circumvent the checks and balances system that is the very bedrock of our government. They have severely weakened the independence of the primary branch of our government \u2013 the Congress\u2014and fought off any court challenges with medieval defenses, such as no American citizen has any standing to sue for harm done by such treaties or the subject is a political, not judicial, matter.\n\nOnly corporations, astonishingly enough, are entitled to sue the U.S. government for any alleged harm to their profits from health, safety or other regulations in secret tribunals that operate as offshore kangaroo courts, not in open courts.\n\nWe Interrupt This Article with an Urgent Message!

President Obama and some members of Congress say that the TPP will be different from NAFTA and the WTO, but I doubt that they have read the entire draft of the TPP. They\u2019re relying on summary memos by the U.S. Trade Office and corporate lawyers, for example, drug companies that sugarcoat the complex monopolistic extension of the pharmaceutical patents and how this will result in higher prices for your medicines.\n\nI challenge President Obama to state publically that he has read the entire TPP. Even a benign monarch would do this for his/her trusting subjects.\n\nInside these hundreds of pages of cross references and repeals of conflicting existing laws is the central subversion, subordinating our protective laws for labor, consumers and the environment (impersonally called \u201cnon-tariff trader barriers\u201d) to the supremacy of international global commercial traffic.\n\nOne very recent example \u2013 by no means the worst possible \u2013 just occurred. After Congress passed a popular \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labeling requirement on meat packages sold in supermarkets, Brazil and Mexico, both exporters of meat to the U.S.A, challenged this U.S. law in a secret (yes, literally secret in all respects) tribunal in Geneva under the World Trade Organization Treaty. Brazil and Mexico won this legal challenge.\n\n\u201cMany Americans will be shocked that the WTO can order our government to deny U.S. consumers the basic information about where their food comes from and that if the information policy is not gutted, we could face millions in sanctions every year,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling spotlights how these so called \u2018trade\u2019 deals are packed with non-trade provisions that threaten our most basic rights, such as even knowing the source and safety of what\u2019s on our dinner plate.\u201d A May 2013 survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that 90% of adult Americans favored this \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d requirement.\n\nFearing billions of dollars in penalties, the U.S. Congress is racing to repeal its own law. See how the noose works: foreign countries trying to pull down our higher standards can take conflicts to secret tribunals with three trade judges, who also have corporate clients and can say to the U.S., \u201cGet rid of your protections or pay billions of dollars in tribute.\u201d\n\nThe same noose can choke efforts by the U.S. to upgrade our health, safety, and economic rights. Had air bags been proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation under today\u2019s global trade uber alles regimes, the proposal would have had to go to a harmonization committee of the WTO\u2019s signatory countries that would sandpaper or reject this life-saving technology. Or if the U.S. went it alone, it would expose itself to repeal or pay by car-exporting nations.\n\nFor ten reasons why the TPP is a bad idea for our country and the world see my recent Common Dreams column.\n\nIf this all sounds so outrageous as to strain credulity, go beneath the tip of this iceberg and visit: Global Trade Warch and Flush the TPP. Then, get ready for the battle over the TPP itself in the late autumn. The following are three examples of how to build resistance to an international problem in your local communities.\n\nFirst, send the legislators who supported the fast track handcuffs a CITIZENS\u2019 SUMMONS to appear at a town meeting where you, not they, present the agenda. If the lawmakers think 500 or more determined people will show up, it is very likely they will relent and meet with you. The unions and other groups working to stop the TPP around the country can get their people to attend these town meetings. August is the congressional recess month. The senators and representative will have no excuse to avoid a town meeting with their constituents. For a list of those legislators who need to be focused on, visit \"Stop Fast Track\".\n\nSecond, hustle together some modest money from groups and individuals, rent an empty storefront, plaster the windows with large signs, and start a rumble of civic resistance in all directions. Politicians sometimes shrug off the warnings of losing contributions from unions. What politicians do fear is their inability to control groups of resurgent voters indeterminately expanding from inside their district or state.\n\nSince opposition to TPP reflects a Left-Right alliance in Congress and back home, store fronts spell real worry for politicians. They should worry because they chose not to do their homework for their home country.\n\nThird, hold rallies designed to attract, collectively, hundreds or thousands of people around the country. These rallies could have an array of high-profile speakers and entertainers, as well as workers who have been harmed by past so-called trade agreements. Rallies can bring in new people and start the process of galvanizing them about the many problems with the TPP.\n\nRemember, 75 percent of Americans think that the TPP should be rejected or delayed according to a bipartisan poll from the Wall Street Journal. People know what these \u201cpull\u2013down,\u201d misnamed trade agreements have done in their own communities.

She had nothing to do with the dispute and was an innocent bystander\u2014a victim, even.

A full 18 months later, as her case finally came before a jury, it's disturbingly clear that the police lied, repeatedly, in an attempt to cover up their murder of Smith.\n\nYvette Smith Shooting - First Police Statement by hsiehnation\n\nAs you may have seen, police not only claimed that Smith emerged from the home with a firearm, they stated that she ignored police commands. In essence, Smith came out of that house, according to police, ready to bring hellfire and damnation on police and they acted out in self-defense from an incredibly dangerous woman.\n\nThis is a lie. A complete fabrication. When Sheriff Terry Pickering issued the statement, he was fully and completely aware that Yvette Smith wasn't armed. No weapon was found on or near her. He knew this. The officers on the scene knew this, but Sheriff Pickering issued that statement anyway. It sounded better.\n\nKnowing that the evidence and scores of eyewitnesses saw that she was unarmed, police later retracted the statement, but have given absolutely no answers or held anyone responsible for the earlier lie\u2014which was the primary reason given for shooting Smith in the first place.\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but the lies get worse\u2014much worse.\n\nAs you saw in the initial statement released by police, they claimed that Smith ignored their commands. On September 17, in open court, we learned that this was also an elaborate lie told to justify police misconduct.\n\n\n\nDeputy Scott Gaskamp, who arrived at the scene just moments before the shooting, had told investigators and written reports stating that they had ordered Smith to show them her hands, to open the door and come out of the house, Gaskamp testified Thursday. Recordings of the incident showed no commands were ever issued.\n\nGaskamp told the court he never amended any of his reports or came forward to investigators to correct his errors. After reviewing the dashboard camera footage caught from his patrol vehicle and Willis\u2019 vehicle, he realized his written reports were wrong and that he had never told Smith to put her hands up or issued any other command. \u201cI did not say those words. It must have been a figment of my imagination,\u201d Gaskamp said.\n\nWhen pressed to explain this in court, Officer Gaskamp literally admitted that he made the whole damn thing up. He also stated that he couldn't remember telling this lie to the lead investigator, until they played him the recorded interview where he stated the lie over and over again.Are you tracking this?

A lieutenant and a sergeant were demoted to patrol deputy and five additional supervisors also faced disciplinary action because of the record changes.\n\nBefore working for Bastrop County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Willis, 29, was employed by Travis County. A Travis County 2012 evaluation of Willis stated that Willis needed more development in handling explosive situations and in the utilization of common sense.\n\nLastly, and this may be the most disturbing fact of all, it was discovered that the officer who shot and killed Smith was found incompetent by another police department.Yes, you read that correctly: The damn evaluation said the police officer who killed Yvette Smith struggled with \"common sense,\" but was hired by a neighboring department anyway.\n\nWhile Officer Willis has been charged in Smith's death, it is increasingly clear that the entire Bastrop County Sheriff's Office conspired to protect one another and cover up this crime. All of them should be immediately fired and a statewide investigation needs to be launched into the corrupt actions that we can clearly see in the murder of Yvette Smith.\n\n"], ["http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hate-speech-laws-First-Amendment-Dershowitz/2014/05/08/id/570277/", "Hate Speech Laws a 'Dangerous Trend'", "Editor's Note:\n\nGovt Prohibited From Helping Seniors (Shocking)\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation calling for the government to investigate \"hate speech\" on broadcast, cable, and Internet outlets \u2014 a bill that is raising concerns from First Amendment advocates and constitutional experts.Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called the enactment of hate speech laws a \"dangerous trend.\"\"I have never in my life seen a successful effort to define hate speech that does not interfere with rights of free expression,\" Dershowitz told Newsmax. \"It is a worthy effort, but my prediction is that it either leads to the conclusion government cannot do it, or that they will do it and that will infringe on First Amendment rights.\"Governments are trying to also make changes to hate speech law and debating the issue in Canada, at the United Nations, and even right now in Israel. It is a worldwide trend, but it is a really dangerous trend,\" Dershowitz said.Announcing the Hate Crime Reporting Act last month, Markey cited three killings at Jewish centers in Kansas by a white supremacist in April, and said in a statement it is \"critical to ensure the Internet, television, and radio are not encouraging hate crimes or hate speech that is not outside the protection of the First Amendment.\"Markey's bill directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to update \"The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes\" report, which was released in 1993 after then-Rep. Markey used the Telecommunications Authorization Act to mandate the study.The NTIA will have a year to \"examine the role of telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes\" and then would deliver that review to the Senate Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.In January, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a similar measure \u2014 HR 3878 \u2014 that also would \"mandate a comprehensive analysis of criminal and hateful activity on the Internet that occurs outside of the zone of the First Amendment protection.\"Ken Paulson, president and CEO of the First Amendment Center, told Newsmax that Markey's bill \"strikes me not only as misguided, but also probably a waste of time.\"Studying the prevalence of hate speech on the web or in any other media is a perfectly legitimate examination for academics who want to explore that issue. It is an entirely different matter when government seeks to do that because inevitably they will act on the report,\" Paulson said.Paulson asserted that even if the report requested by Markey comes back finding a prevalence of hate speech, the government cannot do anything about it as a consequence of First Amendment protections of even the most vile speech.\"There always is the concern when Congress studies an issue because there exists that temptation to act on the results,\" Paulson said. \"If someone posts on the Internet that we should go string someone up and they name that person, and encourage action, that is a different matter. But hateful speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.\"That inherent conflict between government attempts to monitor speech on the Internet and in other media and the First Amendment was not lost on the authors of the initial NTIA report.In the 1993 report, the NTIA stated its concurrence with those who contend the best response to hate speech is more speech, and not government censorship or regulation.The report noted that the \"electronic media can be used to disseminate messages of bigotry and prejudice; they can also be a powerful tool for promoting tolerance, equality, and harmony. The private sector and government should intensify their efforts to make strong statements supporting tolerance and abhorring bigotry. Such action does not involve sanctioning speech or punishing thought.\"The NTIA further stated that the agency \"recognizes the power of telecommunications in disseminating voice, video, or textual messages to large audiences. However, the fact that telecommunications technology can extend and amplify speech does not change the governing First Amendment analysis.\"Conservatives see in both bills a thinly veiled effort to silence or censor conservative voices.\"What the congressional Democrats are targeting isn't virtual Ku Klux Klan rallies. The left slaps the 'hate speech' label on just about anything with which it disagrees. They aim to shut down conservative voices,\" asserted The Washington Times editorial board.Many liberal advocacy groups have expressed their support for the hate crimes bills. Alex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said an updated report \"is long overdue and desperately needed given the incredible evolution of our communications systems over the past 21 years, as well as the ever-increasing numbers of hate crimes targeting Latinos and others.\"The NHMC has been lobbying for an update of the 1993 report for several years. In January 2009, the NHMC filed a Petition for Inquiry at the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine hate speech in media, and also sent a letter to the NTIA, asking it to update its 1993 report.The group's petition was backed up several months later by 40 civil rights and public interest groups that requested the FCC take action.However, some liberals oppose Markey's and Jeffries' bills on First Amendment grounds.Liberal commentator Alan Colmes recently wrote in The Huffington Post that \"no matter how many heinous crimes are committed by deplorable white supremacists, it's inane to make the case that it's because something someone said on the radio. It takes more than a ranting talk show host to instill the kind of hate in someone that spurs this kind of depraved behavior.\"The introduction of the bills comes even as hate crimes have been on the decrease.According to the FBI's 2012 Hate Crimes Statistics, there were 5,796 hate crime incidents reported in 2012, down from 6,222 incidents in 2011.FBI statistics show an even steeper decline in the years since the NTIA report was issued in 1993. In 1996 \u2014 the first year the FBI began comprehensively reporting hate crime figures \u2014 8,759 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported.While Dershowitz believes there is greater freedom of speech today, he noted people tend to be more easily offended and more likely to call for a solution for that offense, which can set a dangerous precedent.\"There is an '-ism' for everything \u2014 racism, sexism, fatism \u2014 and once you give in to one -ism, every other -ism comes back and asks to be treated the same, too. It can be dangerous to satisfy people's sensitivities,\" he said, adding that hurtful words used in political and social debates are \"far different than the incitement that led to massacres in Rwanda.\"In America, the pendulum swings far too widely in reaction to these events. The proper response to hate speech is to answer that speech more often, not to censor it. The best solution and answer to hate speech always has been to keep the marketplace of ideas open.\""], ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34306361?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+yahoo%2FDgLZ+%28Blog4%29#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "US driver shot from police helicopter", "Image copyright AP Image caption Bullet holes were clearly visible in the wreck of the SUV\n\nA driver involved in a high-speed chase in California was struck by gunfire from a police helicopter, officials have confirmed.\n\nThe driver had refused to pull over, police said, and had sped past stop signs and red lights.\n\nPolice opened fire when the car began heading the wrong way on a motorway.

This should've been case closed, but it wasn't.\n\nOn February 16, 2014, Yvette Smith, a 47-year-old mother beloved by her family and community, was shot twice by an AR-15 assault rifle and killed on the spot by local police as she opened the front door of her home. A full 18 months later, as her case finally came before a jury, it's disturbingly clear that the police lied, repeatedly, in an attempt to cover up their murder of Smith.\n\nYvette Smith Shooting - First Police Statement by hsiehnation\n\nAs you may have seen, police not only claimed that Smith emerged from the home with a firearm, they stated that she ignored police commands. In essence, Smith came out of that house, according to police, ready to bring hellfire and damnation on police and they acted out in self-defense from an incredibly dangerous woman.\n\nThis is a lie. A complete fabrication. When Sheriff Terry Pickering issued the statement, he was fully and completely aware that Yvette Smith wasn't armed. No weapon was found on or near her. He knew this. The officers on the scene knew this, but Sheriff Pickering issued that statement anyway. It sounded better.\n\nKnowing that the evidence and scores of eyewitnesses saw that she was unarmed, police later retracted the statement, but have given absolutely no answers or held anyone responsible for the earlier lie\u2014which was the primary reason given for shooting Smith in the first place.\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but the lies get worse\u2014much worse.\n\nAs you saw in the initial statement released by police, they claimed that Smith ignored their commands. On September 17, in open court, we learned that this was also an elaborate lie told to justify police misconduct.\n\n\n\nDeputy Scott Gaskamp, who arrived at the scene just moments before the shooting, had told investigators and written reports stating that they had ordered Smith to show them her hands, to open the door and come out of the house, Gaskamp testified Thursday. Recordings of the incident showed no commands were ever issued.\n\nGaskamp told the court he never amended any of his reports or came forward to investigators to correct his errors. After reviewing the dashboard camera footage caught from his patrol vehicle and Willis\u2019 vehicle, he realized his written reports were wrong and that he had never told Smith to put her hands up or issued any other command. \u201cI did not say those words. It must have been a figment of my imagination,\u201d Gaskamp said.\n\nWhen pressed to explain this in court, Officer Gaskamp literally admitted that he made the whole damn thing up. He also stated that he couldn't remember telling this lie to the lead investigator, until they played him the recorded interview where he stated the lie over and over again.Are you tracking this? Let me summarize it for you . . .\n\nYvette Smith called 911 for help.\n\nShe opened the front door of her home and was almost instantly shot twice by police with an AR-15 assault rifle.\n\nThe officers on the scene lied and said she was armed.\n\nThe supervising officer doubled down on the lie and spread it in a press release.\n\nThe officers then lied and said they made multiple commands that Smith ignored, but the dashcam footage shows that none of those commands were made. Not one of them.\n\nThe coverup continued . . .\n\n\n\nA few weeks after the shooting, an investigation by BCSO revealed that several supervisors had modified Willis\u2019 field training records after the shooting in an effort to make sure the records were completed accurately. A lieutenant and a sergeant were demoted to patrol deputy and five additional supervisors also faced disciplinary action because of the record changes.\n\nBefore working for Bastrop County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Willis, 29, was employed by Travis County. A Travis County 2012 evaluation of Willis stated that Willis needed more development in handling explosive situations and in the utilization of common sense.\n\nLastly, and this may be the most disturbing fact of all, it was discovered that the officer who shot and killed Smith was found incompetent by another police department.Yes, you read that correctly: The damn evaluation said the police officer who killed Yvette Smith struggled with \"common sense,\" but was hired by a neighboring department anyway.\n\nWhile Officer Willis has been charged in Smith's death, it is increasingly clear that the entire Bastrop County Sheriff's Office conspired to protect one another and cover up this crime. All of them should be immediately fired and a statewide investigation needs to be launched into the corrupt actions that we can clearly see in the murder of Yvette Smith.\n\n"], ["http://act.credoaction.com/sign/PP_Hold_the_Line?sp_ref=150164949.4.15659.t.64876.2&referring_akid=15630.5783917.3MlHPI&source=tw_sp", "Democrats can\u2019t compromise when it comes to Planned Parenthood", "\"Democrats in Congress must stand strong against any Republican attacks on women.

Tell congressional Democrats: No cuts to Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nForcing a government shutdown in order to take breast cancer screenings, Pap smears and other preventive health care from women is ugly political gamesmanship that would be extremely unpopular with the majority of Republicans\u2019 constituents.

They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood.

Apparently this follows a pattern of refusals to cooperate that go back as far as the original inspector general investigation back in the early summer.\n\nPagliano had worked with Clinton going back to at least 2006, serving on her original presidential campaign then later at the State Department with continuing duties overseeing the email server. Last week Clinton claimed to have used the secret private email server going back at least to her time as senator from New York:\n\n\u201cI did all my business on my personal email [in the Senate],\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI was not thinking a lot when I got in [to the State Department].

I didn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be.\u201d \u201cThis was fully above board, people knew I was using a personal email, I did it for convenience. I sent emails that I thought were work related to people\u2019s dot gov accounts,\u201d she added.\n\nThis last statement is a direct contradiction to evidence previously revealed that showed that Clinton and her aides had sent information that would later be determined to be classified to at least six other people\u2019s private email addresses, including non-government employee Sidney Blumenthal, the longtime ClintonWorld loyalist who was blocked from taking a position at State by the Obama Administration due to rumors he had spread about President Obama during the 2008 campaign.\n\nAs the Baltimore Sun said today \u201cThere is a smoking gun.

Fox News And The Koch Brothers Have Replaced The GOP", "Everyday there is more and more evidence that the Republican Party is dissolving into the ether of a new political atmosphere. It began with Fox News usurping the PR responsibilities of the party. For anyone to advance in the GOP they had to go through Fox News. At the same time, the Koch brothers have been moving in on party operations and raising more campaign money than the party could ever hope to.\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Corpse has covered this phenomenon in some detail here and here, examining how the interests of Fox News came to supersede those of the GOP:\n\nFox has corralled a stable of the most disreputable, unqualified, extremist, lunatics ever assembled, and is presenting them as experts, analysts, and leaders. These third-rate icons of idiocy are marketed by Fox like any other gag gift (i.e. pet rocks, plastic vomit, Sarah Palin, etc.). [\u2026] The problem is that by elevating bona fide nutcases, they are debasing honest and informed discourse. The mental cases are crowding out any reasonable voices that might exist amongst the more moderate Republicans (if there are any left). Fox appears to have made a tactical decision to permit the inmates full run of the asylum. [\u2026] So even as this helps Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bottom line, it is making celebrities of political bottom-feeders. That can\u2019t be good for the long-term prospects of the Republican Party.\n\nThe trend is accelerating as we go into the 2016 presidential campaign season. Now Fox has appointed itself the gatekeeper of the GOP primary, wherein they will only permit the top ten Republican candidates, as determined by certain unnamed polls, to participate in their televised debates. Even Republican party operatives are opposed to this power grab by a media company.\n\nIn addition to Fox News assuming the roll of party spokesman, the billionaire Koch brothers are angling to replace the party\u2019s electoral architects by building and distributing the voter access tools and outreach capability that used to be the sole province of the political party. Yahoo News published an in-depth investigation that shows how the Koch\u2019s syndicate has moved in on party territory, much to the consternation of the party chieftains.\n\n\u201cThe RNC is now openly arguing, however, that the Kochs\u2019 political operation is trying to control the Republican Party\u2019s master voter file, and to gain influence over \u2014 some even say control of \u2014 the GOP. \u201c\u2018I think it\u2019s very dangerous and wrong to allow a group of very strong, well-financed individuals who have no accountability to anyone to have control over who gets access to the data when, why and how,\u2019 said Katie Walsh, the RNC\u2019s chief of staff.\u201d\n\nSo if the Koch brothers end up running the electoral operations of Republican candidates, and Fox News continues its role in media strategy and execution, the only question that remains is: What\u2019s left for the remnants of the Republican Party to do? They become an organization with no authority, responsibility, or relevance.\n\nIf they don\u2019t take steps to reverse these trends, and do it soon, the GOP will drift into an ignoble and faded history. Ordinarily, that might not seem like such a horrible idea. But if their replacement is Fox News and the Koch brothers, we might all be better off rooting for the GOP.\n\nNews Corpse Presents: The ALL NEW 2nd volume of\n\nFox Nation vs. Reality: The Fox News Cult of Ignorance.\n\nAvailable now at Amazon."], ["http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/09/18/1422588/-Texas-police-caught-in-an-enormous-lie-about-their-murder-of-an-unarmed-mother-Yvette-Smith", "Texas police caught in an enormous lie about their murder of unarmed mother Yvette Smith", "Below, see the initial statement from Sheriff Terry Pickering, issued just hours after Smith died.\n\nWhen Smith opened the front door of her home, she was shot twice with a high-powered .223 caliber rifle in less than two seconds by Officer Daniel Willis of Bastrop County, Texas, outside of Austin.\n\nFirst off, Smith called 911 for help because two men in her home were arguing over a financial dispute and she felt it was getting out of hand.

It offers a buffer against responsibility, a way to shift blame and deflect cause and effect. But the truth, and numbers, tell a different story. At the heart of an increasingly violent society is not a subculture among Blacks, but the violence and criminality of many Americans, and whites in particular. No one seems to speak about this. Why?

They also want to destroy an institution that fights every day for women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s why we have to make sure Democrats make no compromises when it comes to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBefore the August vote, we delivered more than 330,000 signatures from CREDO members telling Republicans not to play politics with women\u2019s lives and telling Democrats to stand in support of Planned Parenthood. CREDO is Planned Parenthood\u2019s biggest corporate donor, and our members sent more than $80,000 to Planned Parenthood in August after the video scandal broke.

This term \u201cfast track\u201d is a euphemism for your members of Congress \u2013 senators and representatives \u2013 handcuffing themselves, so as to prevent any amendments or adequate debate before the final vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 another euphemism that is used to avoid the word \u201ctreaty,\u201d which would require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate. This anti-democratic process is being pushed by \u201cKing Obama\u201d and his royal court.\n\nMake no mistake. If this was only a trade treaty \u2013 reducing tariffs, quotas, and the like \u2013 it would not be so controversial. Yet, the corporate-indentured politicians keep calling this gigantic treaty with thirty chapters, of which only five relate to traditional trade issues, a trade agreement instead of a treaty. The other twenty-four chapters, if passed as they are, will have serious impacts on your livelihoods as workers and consumers, as well as your air, water, food, and medicines\n\nThe reason I call President Obama \u201cKing Obama\u201d in this case is that he, and his massive corporate lobbies (royal court), have sought to circumvent the checks and balances system that is the very bedrock of our government. They have severely weakened the independence of the primary branch of our government \u2013 the Congress\u2014and fought off any court challenges with medieval defenses, such as no American citizen has any standing to sue for harm done by such treaties or the subject is a political, not judicial, matter.\n\nOnly corporations, astonishingly enough, are entitled to sue the U.S. government for any alleged harm to their profits from health, safety or other regulations in secret tribunals that operate as offshore kangaroo courts, not in open courts.\n\nWe Interrupt This Article with an Urgent Message!

President Obama and some members of Congress say that the TPP will be different from NAFTA and the WTO, but I doubt that they have read the entire draft of the TPP. They\u2019re relying on summary memos by the U.S. Trade Office and corporate lawyers, for example, drug companies that sugarcoat the complex monopolistic extension of the pharmaceutical patents and how this will result in higher prices for your medicines.\n\nI challenge President Obama to state publically that he has read the entire TPP. Even a benign monarch would do this for his/her trusting subjects.\n\nInside these hundreds of pages of cross references and repeals of conflicting existing laws is the central subversion, subordinating our protective laws for labor, consumers and the environment (impersonally called \u201cnon-tariff trader barriers\u201d) to the supremacy of international global commercial traffic.\n\nOne very recent example \u2013 by no means the worst possible \u2013 just occurred. After Congress passed a popular \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d labeling requirement on meat packages sold in supermarkets, Brazil and Mexico, both exporters of meat to the U.S.A, challenged this U.S. law in a secret (yes, literally secret in all respects) tribunal in Geneva under the World Trade Organization Treaty. Brazil and Mexico won this legal challenge.\n\n\u201cMany Americans will be shocked that the WTO can order our government to deny U.S. consumers the basic information about where their food comes from and that if the information policy is not gutted, we could face millions in sanctions every year,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling spotlights how these so called \u2018trade\u2019 deals are packed with non-trade provisions that threaten our most basic rights, such as even knowing the source and safety of what\u2019s on our dinner plate.\u201d A May 2013 survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that 90% of adult Americans favored this \u201ccountry-of-origin\u201d requirement.\n\nFearing billions of dollars in penalties, the U.S. Congress is racing to repeal its own law. See how the noose works: foreign countries trying to pull down our higher standards can take conflicts to secret tribunals with three trade judges, who also have corporate clients and can say to the U.S., \u201cGet rid of your protections or pay billions of dollars in tribute.\u201d\n\nThe same noose can choke efforts by the U.S. to upgrade our health, safety, and economic rights. Had air bags been proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation under today\u2019s global trade uber alles regimes, the proposal would have had to go to a harmonization committee of the WTO\u2019s signatory countries that would sandpaper or reject this life-saving technology. Or if the U.S. went it alone, it would expose itself to repeal or pay by car-exporting nations.\n\nFor ten reasons why the TPP is a bad idea for our country and the world see my recent Common Dreams column.\n\nIf this all sounds so outrageous as to strain credulity, go beneath the tip of this iceberg and visit: Global Trade Warch and Flush the TPP. Then, get ready for the battle over the TPP itself in the late autumn. The following are three examples of how to build resistance to an international problem in your local communities.\n\nFirst, send the legislators who supported the fast track handcuffs a CITIZENS\u2019 SUMMONS to appear at a town meeting where you, not they, present the agenda. If the lawmakers think 500 or more determined people will show up, it is very likely they will relent and meet with you. The unions and other groups working to stop the TPP around the country can get their people to attend these town meetings. August is the congressional recess month. The senators and representative will have no excuse to avoid a town meeting with their constituents. For a list of those legislators who need to be focused on, visit \"Stop Fast Track\".\n\nSecond, hustle together some modest money from groups and individuals, rent an empty storefront, plaster the windows with large signs, and start a rumble of civic resistance in all directions. Politicians sometimes shrug off the warnings of losing contributions from unions. What politicians do fear is their inability to control groups of resurgent voters indeterminately expanding from inside their district or state.\n\nSince opposition to TPP reflects a Left-Right alliance in Congress and back home, store fronts spell real worry for politicians. They should worry because they chose not to do their homework for their home country.\n\nThird, hold rallies designed to attract, collectively, hundreds or thousands of people around the country. These rallies could have an array of high-profile speakers and entertainers, as well as workers who have been harmed by past so-called trade agreements. Rallies can bring in new people and start the process of galvanizing them about the many problems with the TPP.\n\nRemember, 75 percent of Americans think that the TPP should be rejected or delayed according to a bipartisan poll from the Wall Street Journal. People know what these \u201cpull\u2013down,\u201d misnamed trade agreements have done in their own communities.

Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\u201d\n\nFive million acres in Alaska. 300,000 acres in the rainforest(!) of Washington\u2019s Olympic peninsula, one of the wettest places on the continent. Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Hogan and Kessler both were in elite form for this meeting, but Stanford's offensive line largely made the difference against USC's defense.\n\n\"We were in position to win, but we were doing things that we weren't doing in practice,\" USC safety Chris Hawkins said.\n\nUSC won the opening coin toss and ran the ball right at the Cardinal, going 76 yards on a methodical opening drive capped by Tre Madden's 5-yard TD run.\n\nStanford played without two key contributors on its injury-plagued defensive line, leaving the Cardinal with no tested depth behind its three starters. USC rarely had trouble moving the ball, but hurt itself with eight penalties and didn't get many drives, thanks to Stanford's clock-chewing offense.\n\nHogan and his teammates quickly found the groove they missed in their first two games. The senior quarterback had plenty of time to pick apart USC's secondary for 221 yards passing in the first half, including Hooper's 16-yard TD catch late in the first half.\n\nSmith-Schuster put the Trojans up 21-10 with a 54-yard catch-and-run TD in the second quarter, but Stanford scored twice in the final 3:53 of the first half. Cajuste put the Cardinal up 24-21 with 3 seconds left with a 17-yard TD catch when Adoree Jackson slipped and fell.\n\nJackson also had an early 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown erased by a penalty.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org"], ["http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/thai-teacher-arrested-us-tip-off-obscene-photos-33890630?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Thai Teacher Arrested After US Tip-off on Obscene Photos", "Police in Thailand arrested a former primary school teacher who they said admitted to having sexually abused 24 schoolgirls, after a tip-off from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe former teacher, identified as Decha Pradit, told police that he paid his young students 10 baht, the equivalent of 30 U.S. cents, and told them not to tell their parents, police Col.

Hey, he e-mailed back, Sanders has a good chance of winning both states. I asked if he really thought that. No, he admitted, he was just managing my expectations.\n\nWell, manage these expectations.\n\nNow Sanders is ahead in both states, and is much closer in national polls. His renown has spread so dramatically that James Bond star Daniel Craig, whom he's never met and is about to begin heavy promotion of Spectre, gave nearly $50,000 to a pro-Sanders super PAC (which Sanders disavows) and Sanders is on the cover of Time Magazine. \"I never expected this to catch on so fast,\" Sanders marveled as he discussed Craig's surprise support in a network TV interview.\n\n\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders says he is \"stunned\" that he is doing so well at this stage in the Democratic presidential race.\n\nIt's an extraordinary situation. Sanders was a '60s radical who made his way from New York City to tiny rural Vermont as part of the back-to-the-land kick, with an inconclusive sojourn at the University of Chicago in between. But compared to the brilliant, impactful Hayden -- who, not incidentally, is a big Sanders supporter now -- Sanders was a decidedly lesser, local light in his movement days.\n\nI met him a few years back when curmudgeonly California Democratic Party chairman John Burton, who's made a point of not featuring Obama administration officials, had now U.S. Senator Sanders keynote the state Democratic convention. It was all intelligent and passionate stuff, with self-proclaimed socialist Sanders making his expected left-wing points on the increasingly inegalitarian financialized economy and the decidedly ill-starred post-9/11 conflicts. But I never got the impression I was with a potential President of the United States.\n\nBut something, to borrow a phrase from Stephen Stills, is happening here.\n\nWhile Brit Craig, who is able to contribute to American campaigns as a permanent resident, was flashing his support for Sanders, the British Labour Party was turning overwhelmingly to its most left-wing candidate to lead the party, longtime hard left parliamentary backbencher Jeremy Corbyn. Call it part of the ongoing profound disappointment and anger many feel with former Prime Minister Tony Blair, a longtime ally of the Clintons, for his championing of the invasion of Iraq and acquiescence to the primacy of the investment class in the British economy. With the rise of Sanders, it seems that something much like that is taking place here as well.\n\nI think socialism is becoming popular sooner than I expected. With technology inexorably solving scarcity as it eliminates good-paying jobs, a push for a more socialist approach has seemed to me to be inevitable. But it's happening faster than I thought, probably because the Obama recovery has been so uneven and, for most, rather hollow, disappointing many Democrats even more than his Afghan War escalation and amorphous secret global war on terror. I also think the voters are less acquiescent than I expected in general with regard to the usual political palaver, in small part accounting for the Donald Trump nonsense in the Republican Party.\n\nThe reality is that a lot of what Hillary Clinton has been doing this year as a candidate is good, better than before. Trying to link her candidacy not just with the history of being the first woman president -- which of course is largely about her -- but also with the legacy of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt is well considered. But folks, at least in hyper-sensitive Iowa and New Hampshire, where they take their role as early presidential arbiters oh-so-seriously, aren't buying it all that much.\n\nHillary has always tried to be inevitable, until earlier this year. She is really suffering from that very insipid memoir of her tenure as US secretary of state, which she followed up notoriously with a big buck-raking lecture tour. And then there is the ongoing controversy about her private e-mail system as secretary of state. No smoking gun has been found, and I doubt there is one, but the endless nature of it all keeps spurring underlying concerns about her authenticity.\n\nThere are major elements underlying the rise of Sanders.\n\nVeteran Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, an old friend and colleague who did polling and strategy for another Vermonter, former Governor Howard Dean, who blazed like a comet across the firmament of Democratic presidential presidential politics in 2004, was kind enough to compare and contrast the two:\n\n\"Dean filled a void--caused mainly by the party's sell-out and timidity on Iraq--though it went well beyond that. But it was definitely a reaction to the four years of Bush and some hangover from the Clinton years. In the end, however, he was fairly easily shunted aside and coopted by the likes of Kerry and Edwards. The truth is he wasn't burning to be President.\n\n\n\n\"This is much more of a pure HRC dynamic in one sense. Everyone knows she is the big frontrunner and is supposed to win. And Sanders is exploiting both anger with the GOP congress and some of the disappointment with Obama. So in some ways Sanders has a deeper well to draw from though he is coming from a much more extreme place than Dean and is facing a more capable, perhaps, adversary in Hillary.\"\n\nNow for more of the downside for Sanders.\n\nWhy is it that Tom Hayden himself isn't in this position to run for president? The short answer is that Hayden was too famous for his radicalism when he started out in electoral politics. While he liked to say that \"the radicalism of the '60s is the common sense of the '70s,\" that was not exactly right. And Hayden certainly wasn't sneaking up on anyone.\n\nThe long answer is that Sanders benefits from not being nearly so visible as Hayden in the '60s and '70s radical movements. His radicalism is not so well known. And when Hayden sought public office, he didn't go away to a little state to do it, he did it in the biggest state of all.\n\nI don't know if Sanders made as incendiary statements as Hayden did back in the day. (Though I suspect he made statements that won't fly today and bet the Republican opposition researchers already know about them.) If he did not, it's probably only because he didn't have the opportunity to do so, since he was not one of the national leaders of the movement.\n\nSanders also had the benefit of being able to fail repeatedly in a low-risk environment. Hayden, famous as he was, in California, married to Jane Fonda, had limited room for error. He couldn't afford to get six percent of the vote in statewide races as Sanders did before finally becoming mayor of tiny Burlington, Vermont, less than half the size of micro-people's republics in Santa Monica and Berkeley.\n\nWhen Hayden ran for the U.S. Senate, it was a big deal. And it was a big deal when he got a big primary vote in 1976, leading in the view of some to the crippling of incumbent Senator John Tunney, who went on to lose to Republican university president S.I. Hayakawa.\n\nThough Sanders had a more risk-free environment in Vermont, Hayden's struggles may yet prefigure long-term trouble for Sanders.\n\nBecause you know he said and wrote some radical things that may be hard to explain away.\n\nHayden certainly did. In fact, it nearly prevented him from winning elective office at all.\n\nHayden, a terrific writer, had gotten to know Jerry Brown early on, penning an excellent late 1974 Rolling Stone profile of the young California governor called \"The Mystic and the Machine\". A few years later, Hayden became a high-profile and useful part of the Brown administration, promoting renewable energy and energy conservation policies as chairman of SolarCal.\n\nSo Hayden had a mainstream record to run on when he sought a seat in the California Assembly in 1982. But the going proved to be extremely tough, even in one of the most liberal districts in the state on the West Side of Los Angeles.\n\nAfter a relatively narrow win in the Democratic primary -- despite being very well-financed by Fonda and a good fundraising base developed for his statewide Campaign for Economic Democracy organization -- Hayden received what might be described as a full visitation of the ghost of Christmas past. Voters were suddenly paying a lot of attention to billboards which sprung up all over the West Side emblazoned with incendiary Hayden quotes.\n\nThings like ... \"If blood is going to flow, let it flow all over this city - Tom Hayden.\" \"Property is theft - Tom Hayden.\" ... Like that. Maybe out of context, or not entirely accurate, they were nonetheless impossible to miss. It was so wild that it was funny. But it was also devastating, as it pointed to a not unlikely conclusion in which Hayden ended up seeming too much the illegitimate anti-American extremist even for a liberal Democratic district.\n\nThe late media maven Sidney Galanty prepared an excellent humanizing 60-second TV ad (which would air throughout the LA media market) in which Hayden talked about why he wasn't \"the same angry young man I used to be.\" But there was an ominous silence from many name Democrats.\n\nIn little-known Bill Hawkins, Hayden faced a very dangerous Republican opponent, a cipher, a man with no record to run against, one who espoused rather liberal views in tune with the district.\n\nSomething special needed to be done.\n\nDespite some past statements I would not have made, I knew that Hayden and Fonda, with whom I did not always agree, were not only not traitors, they were patriots. Patriots, that is, who in the white hot heat of the Vietnam War protests had done incredibly incautious things. I also knew that Hayden and Fonda had been among the most spied-upon of American citizens. (Dick Cheney began his Sith Lord duties, as Gerald Ford's deputy White House chief of staff 40 years ago, trying to shut down a New York Times story revealing that the CIA had violated its charter by spying on the anti-war movement here in America.)\n\nSo it only seemed fair that Hayden should at last get some spycraft working on his behalf.\n\nSitting in a rather morose meeting at Hayden's Santa Monica headquarters, surrounded by works from Fonda's blue-chip Pop Art collection, I had an idea. I would get Hayden's opponent on tape espousing policies directly contrary to what his campaign said his positions were. Posing as a Republican contributor, I was able to do just that.\n\nWhen the Hayden campaign finally revealed that Hawkins was simply lying about his positions -- I had gone on to do opposition research for LA Mayor Tom Bradley's near-miss (read: blown) campaign for governor -- the Republican's campaign was shocked and staggered.\n\n\n\nTom Hayden and Jane Fonda discussed their plans to travel here in the US and throughout Europe to expose Nixon's bombing of Hanoi and other Vietnam War moves in the early 1970s. Bernie Sanders was nowhere near as high-profile as that.\n\nIn normal circumstances, the race would have ended then and there. But, and here's the ominous point for Sanders and his enthusiasts, these were not normal circumstances. The campaign was not yet over. While Hawkins never recovered from the shock of revelation, Hayden still had to run flat out to convince enough voters that he was not too extreme to serve in public office.\n\nWith help from his new campaign chairman, revered former Governor Pat Brown -- who said: \"I'll take Tom Hayden over those phonies any day\" -- and some others, Hayden won by nine points in a district that normally went Democratic by a couple of times that. He spent what was then by far a national record amount for a state legislative race, $1.75 million. Hayden's opposition spent more than that, mostly in independent expenditures.\n\nIn subsequent elections, Hayden won by much more, though he had to win a squeaker over an incumbent to move to the Senate after his Assembly district was gutted in reapportionment. During 10 years in the state Assembly and eight years in the Senate before term limits caught up with him, Hayden proved a great champion of the clean energy path and other worthy things. But statewide office proved beyond his reach.\n\nNow, with regard to Sanders, there just might not be someone able to get whomever the Republican presidential nominee turns out to be to admit that he's really Darth Vader. And there's no widely-revered Pat Brown type figure on the national scene to reassure swing voters that Sanders is really a neat-o fellow despite all this crazy stuff you're hearing about him.\n\nIt's just four-and-a-half months before the voting starts in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Nevada and South Carolina rounding out the early spate of contests. Yet there is still plenty of time for many things to happen.\n\nFor example, we'll soon see if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race. My guess is no. Biden staying out helps Hillary, making it easier for her to retain more of the vote that is pleased with the Obama years.\n\nBut the fact that she's behind in Iowa and New Hampshire as the fall before the voting begins has to be alarming for the Clintons. No Democrat who has not won Iowa or New Hampshire has gone on to victory. Not that it can't be done, but that's not the sort of first a candidate heading to the White House is looking to garner.\n\nThere's clearly a growing rejection of the notion of accepting bland political mush, of settling for a politics which acquiesces in if it does not accelerate the further empowerment of the 0.1 percent and a future of unaccountable war stretching beyond the foreseeable horizon.\n\nI suspect the Clintons, once joined at the hip to Tony Blair and all too cognizant of his woes, know this. They might even be willing to do something about it. But is their credibility elastic enough to bounce back?\n\nFacebook comments are closed on this article.\n\nWilliam Bradley Archive"], ["https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3lmv0w/nate_silver_trump_has_about_5_chance_of_winning/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "Trump Has About 5% Chance Of Winning", "Want to join?

Gov. Casey Cagle, who endorsed Bush last month and introduced the candidate as someone who \"stands for everything that the party needs to be espousing.\"\n\nBush, with signs behind him that tweaked his \"Jeb!\" campaign logo to look like the SEC logo, spoke for only three minutes. \"I'm going to be very brief because I really like taking selfies,\" he said to big cheers from the crowd.\n\nThe candidate performed a condensed version of his stump speech, promising to grow the economy by 4.4% so that students can get jobs when they graduate and buy homes. \"A conservative can win the presidency and then fix these things so that you all will have a chance to live a great life,\" he said.\n\nThen it was back to selfies for another 50 minutes.\n\nFollowing his widely praised performance at the CNN debate on Wednesday, Bush hasn't been as eager to bring up contrasts with his rival, Donald Trump, by name in his speeches as he has been in recent weeks.\n\nStill, Bush jumped at the chance to mock Trump at one point Saturday when a voter near him commented on Bush being \"high energy.\" The former governor whipped around to follow up: \"Very high energy!\"\n\nFriday night at an event in Michigan, Bush pounced on the latest controversy involving Trump and a supporter who argued at a rally this week that the president was a Muslim and questioned his status as an American. Bush defended Obama on Friday night, asserting that he was an American and a Christian.\n\nThe initial incident -- which Trump didn't try to correct or denounce, saying later that he didn't fully hear the question -- renewed dialogue about tension in the United States between Muslims and non-Muslims.\n\n\"I don't think that there's a problem with Muslims in America,\" Bush told reporters Saturday. \"I think there's a problem with Islamic terrorism in the rest of the world and we need to confront that.\"\n\nBush added that \"of course\" Obama was born in the United States. Pressed on whether Trump should apologize for not calling out the questioner at his rally, Bush declined to weigh in further.\n\n\"I'm not really, I'm here watching the football game. Donald Trump's not really on my mind anymore,\" he said.\n\nThough the two quarreled Wednesday night in the debate, they also high-fived each other toward the end. Bush said Saturday that he doesn't hold any \"personal animus\" against Trump, but when asked whether Trump should still apologize to his wife for invoking her in the debate about immigration, Bush said: \"Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.\"\n\nThis week, Bush also got some attention from younger voters after he admitted on the debate stage that he smoked marijuana four decades ago. \"I'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people,\" he said, looking around at his rivals on stage. \"My mom's not happy that I just did.\"\n\nAsked Saturday whether he had heard from his mother yet, Bush said he tried calling the former first lady this week but she wasn't available. \"Thankfully, she wasn't there,\" he said. \"I think she'll forgive me after 42 years, you think?\"\n\nWith a few crushed beer cans on the grass around him and the smell of alcohol in the air, it was clear that at least some of the enthusiasm at the boisterous tailgate was owed to normal game day libations. Only water was served at the event, but anyone was free to wander over and several came with drinks in tow.\n\nBush politely advised a couple of young people to pace themselves.\"Slow down there,\" he said to one young woman who was keenly fascinated with a sticker on his shirt. \"We haven't even gotten to kickoff yet.\"\n\nAs for who the candidate was rooting for at the game, Bush said he was neutral, though he predicted Georgia would beat the Gamecocks.\n\n\"I think Georgia's going to win the SEC East,\" he added, as he was taking photos with a few South Carolina fans.\n\nThe Georgia fans quickly broke out into loud cheers: \"Jeb for 2016!\""], ["http://www.wbir.com/story/news/2015/09/17/lawmakers-file-tennessee-natural-marriage-defense-act/72369044/", "Lawmakers file 'Tennessee Natural Marriage Defense Act'", "Tennessee lawmakers promised some sort of legislative response after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal for every state in the country.

But the recent Supreme Court case ruled states cannot ban same-sex couples from receiving marriage licenses and must recognize same-sex marriages officiated in other states.\n\nGov. Bill Haslam and Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery, both Republicans, said they didn't agree with the ruling, but they said Tennessee would follow the Supreme Court. Every county clerk in Tennessee is issuing same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nIt's unclear what effect the new bill would have if enacted on those licenses in Tennessee. The eight-page bill consists mainly of reasons why Pody and Beavers believe Tennessee can and should ignore the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Whereas, not all orders claiming authority under color of law are in fact lawful,\" the bill reads in part.\n\n\"Whereas, unlawful orders, no matter their source \u2014 whether from a military commander, a federal judge, or the United States Supreme Court \u2014 are and remain unlawful, and should be resisted.\"\n\nThe bill says the attorney general must defend any state or local official from any lawsuit that could \u2014 and would \u2014 arise if the bill is enacted. It also says no state or local agency may enforce the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, or any other decision that might allow same-sex marriage. Officials abiding by the bill, if enacted, couldn't be fined or arrested for ignoring the U.S. Supreme Court, the bill states.\n\nOther lawmakers already introduced a bill to \"protect\" clergy members from being forced to officiate same-sex weddings. Nowhere in the Supreme Court ruling does it say pastors or preachers must officiate any wedding.\n\nLawmakers return to legislative work when the General Assembly reconvenes in January.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.wbir.com/1F5syQI"], ["http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article35615715.html", "North Carolina to privatize Medicaid", "Seen as a remedy for unpredictable spending in $15 billion program\n\nPayments per-patient instead of for each service\n\nVotes set for next week"], ["http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/18/fact-republican-run-red-states-americas-highest-poverty-rates.html", "Republican Run Red States Have America's Highest Poverty Rates", "During the protests against America\u2019s involvement in the Viet Nam war, it became very popular for warmongers and so-called patriots to tell young men facing losing their lives in a worthless war and those protesting to save them that this is \u201cAmerica, love it or leave it.\u201d The implication was that since Congress adhered to the Constitution in waging war, regardless the devastating consequences, the American people were obliged to either show their love of country and support the war or get out. There is a segment of the population today that hates America, its people, and the nation\u2019s founding document, but instead of packing up and leaving the country, they have tasked Republicans to punish the entire population by legislating that all Americans suffer their lifestyle founded on poverty, bigotry, ill-health, and religious ignorance. Although there are Americans who hate this nation across the country, it is the former Confederacy that is punishing the people because they failed in their attempt to destroy America of their rejection of the United States Constitution they claim to love.\n\nSouthern states are still resentful they were unable to rip America apart because the Constitution forbade them from keeping dark-skinned human beings as livestock, so they spent the past 149 years punishing different groups of Americans based on their religion\u2019s instruction manual (Christian bible). Over the past thirty years, angry southerners began electing Republicans to strip everything from the people until they relented to a government by bible that drove their attempt to restrict other Americans from their Constitutional freedoms. Republicans have happily accommodated southerners to bring down the rest of the nation to their level of poverty and distress that southern red state voters embrace so long as they have imaginary enemies who believe Americans deserve more than slave wages, sickness, dire poverty, prayer, and firearms.\n\nIt is fairly common knowledge the former Confederacy considered owning human beings a biblically-supported and constitutional right according to their interpretation of the 10th Amendment. But even after losing the Civil War they persisted in targeting other groups for discrimination with biblical justification. Since their war against America, southern states opposed interracial marriage, women\u2019s right to vote, civil rights, voting rights, women\u2019s right to choose their reproductive health, and recently gay rights. The impetus for their opposition to those rights guaranteed in the Constitution is founded in their religion and since they were prohibited by the Constitution from depriving those groups of their rights, they have taken out their anger on the rest of the population by electing Republicans to Congress who promise to subject every American to conditions red southern state residents live under including poverty, slave wages, sickness and disease, and no hope of ever escaping their chosen lifestyle.\n\nIt is difficult for reasonable Americans to comprehend why voters in the South continue electing Republicans that campaign on perpetuating living conditions most Americans consider unacceptable. It is not because they believe all Americans live in poverty and love it, or that they are unaware their miserable plight is unavoidable. Most likely they are willing to live in poverty and ill-health with no chance of escaping because they are angry the rest of the nation will not tolerate their bigotry and hate; their only recourse is electing Republicans to legislate America into one big red state mired in bigotry, religion, guns, and deep poverty.\n\nAccording to The Department of Agriculture\u2019s measure of poverty, every red state from Arizona to South Carolina has the highest poverty rates in America; between 17.9% and 22.8%. The so-called bible belt is America\u2019s poverty belt including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. According to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, nearly one in four children trapped in Southern red states live in dire poverty and parents of those children elect Republicans to make those despicable statistics uniform across America. Part and parcel of conditions driving the South\u2019s poverty is low wages that voters elect Republicans to perpetuate across America.\n\nSouthern states are hostile to organized labor, five states have no state minimum wage, most are \u201cright to work for less\u201d states, and the 10 states with the lowest average incomes are in the former Confederacy including Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma according to the Equality of Economic Opportunity Project. Republicans in Congress promote policies that create poverty across the South and red state voters elect them anyway to subject the entire nation to low wages and the poverty they engender.\n\nThe depth of Southern voters\u2019 hatred for other Americans and their own families is evident in their support for Republicans that rejected expanding Medicaid in most of the South. According to a map by the Urban Institute, counties with the most people without healthcare insurance are in the Southern United States and it defies comprehension why voters support Republicans who prevent their children, parents, brothers and sisters from access to healthcare that does not cost states one cent for the first few years and only 10% (at most) thereafter. The same voters avidly oppose the Affordable Care Act that reveals they want tens-of-millions of Americans to suffer the same ill-health and disease they choose for their families.\n\nIt is unfathomable that residents in southern red states reject attempts to help them climb out of poverty and sickness, but religion and guns are powerful motivators for people still holding a grudge over being prevented from owning slaves, restricting women\u2019s rights, and discriminating against Americans according to their religious beliefs. It is no coincidence that the poorest Southern states are also the most religious and have the most firearm violence. In fact, the poorest states have the highest incidence of gun violence to go along with some of the highest gun ownership rates that Republicans take advantage of by joining the National Rifle Association fear mongering that President Obama is coming after their guns as fervently as he is coming after their religious liberty.\n\nMany pundits assert the conditions in southern red states are the fault of Republican-dominated legislatures, but without voters electing Republicans and teabaggers to preserve the deplorable conditions southern states would not lead the nation in poverty. Unfortunately, the same people electing Republicans at the state level vote for Republicans in Congress because they promise to oppose Democrats and President Obama\u2019s campaign to disarm Southern state residents\u2019 of their guns and bibles. It is certain that if President Obama and Democrats supported religious-driven bigotry and gun fanaticism, red southern state voters would reciprocate and support policies giving them decent wages, healthcare, and domestic programs to combat poverty. However, since that will never happen they will vote to elect Republicans to Congress to impose their deplorable living conditions on the entire population and spread their real America to every state in the Union."], ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/the-sanders-saga-why-is-a_b_8164596.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics", "The Sanders Saga: Why Is \"A Half-Baked Version of Tom Hayden\" Beating the Clintons?", "Last month, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders leading Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire primary polls and getting closer but still well behind in first-in-the-nation caucus state Iowa, I asked an old Clintonista how it could be that \"a half-baked version of Tom Hayden\" had a shot at beating the Clintons. Hey, he e-mailed back, Sanders has a good chance of winning both states. I asked if he really thought that. No, he admitted, he was just managing my expectations.\n\nWell, manage these expectations.\n\nNow Sanders is ahead in both states, and is much closer in national polls. His renown has spread so dramatically that James Bond star Daniel Craig, whom he's never met and is about to begin heavy promotion of Spectre, gave nearly $50,000 to a pro-Sanders super PAC (which Sanders disavows) and Sanders is on the cover of Time Magazine. \"I never expected this to catch on so fast,\" Sanders marveled as he discussed Craig's surprise support in a network TV interview.\n\n\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders says he is \"stunned\" that he is doing so well at this stage in the Democratic presidential race.\n\nIt's an extraordinary situation. Sanders was a '60s radical who made his way from New York City to tiny rural Vermont as part of the back-to-the-land kick, with an inconclusive sojourn at the University of Chicago in between. But compared to the brilliant, impactful Hayden -- who, not incidentally, is a big Sanders supporter now -- Sanders was a decidedly lesser, local light in his movement days.\n\nI met him a few years back when curmudgeonly California Democratic Party chairman John Burton, who's made a point of not featuring Obama administration officials, had now U.S. Senator Sanders keynote the state Democratic convention. It was all intelligent and passionate stuff, with self-proclaimed socialist Sanders making his expected left-wing points on the increasingly inegalitarian financialized economy and the decidedly ill-starred post-9/11 conflicts. But I never got the impression I was with a potential President of the United States.\n\nBut something, to borrow a phrase from Stephen Stills, is happening here.\n\nWhile Brit Craig, who is able to contribute to American campaigns as a permanent resident, was flashing his support for Sanders, the British Labour Party was turning overwhelmingly to its most left-wing candidate to lead the party, longtime hard left parliamentary backbencher Jeremy Corbyn. Call it part of the ongoing profound disappointment and anger many feel with former Prime Minister Tony Blair, a longtime ally of the Clintons, for his championing of the invasion of Iraq and acquiescence to the primacy of the investment class in the British economy. With the rise of Sanders, it seems that something much like that is taking place here as well.\n\nI think socialism is becoming popular sooner than I expected. With technology inexorably solving scarcity as it eliminates good-paying jobs, a push for a more socialist approach has seemed to me to be inevitable. But it's happening faster than I thought, probably because the Obama recovery has been so uneven and, for most, rather hollow, disappointing many Democrats even more than his Afghan War escalation and amorphous secret global war on terror. I also think the voters are less acquiescent than I expected in general with regard to the usual political palaver, in small part accounting for the Donald Trump nonsense in the Republican Party.\n\nThe reality is that a lot of what Hillary Clinton has been doing this year as a candidate is good, better than before. Trying to link her candidacy not just with the history of being the first woman president -- which of course is largely about her -- but also with the legacy of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt is well considered. But folks, at least in hyper-sensitive Iowa and New Hampshire, where they take their role as early presidential arbiters oh-so-seriously, aren't buying it all that much.\n\nHillary has always tried to be inevitable, until earlier this year. She is really suffering from that very insipid memoir of her tenure as US secretary of state, which she followed up notoriously with a big buck-raking lecture tour. And then there is the ongoing controversy about her private e-mail system as secretary of state. No smoking gun has been found, and I doubt there is one, but the endless nature of it all keeps spurring underlying concerns about her authenticity.\n\nThere are major elements underlying the rise of Sanders.\n\nVeteran Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, an old friend and colleague who did polling and strategy for another Vermonter, former Governor Howard Dean, who blazed like a comet across the firmament of Democratic presidential presidential politics in 2004, was kind enough to compare and contrast the two:\n\n\"Dean filled a void--caused mainly by the party's sell-out and timidity on Iraq--though it went well beyond that. But it was definitely a reaction to the four years of Bush and some hangover from the Clinton years. In the end, however, he was fairly easily shunted aside and coopted by the likes of Kerry and Edwards. The truth is he wasn't burning to be President.\n\n\n\n\"This is much more of a pure HRC dynamic in one sense. Everyone knows she is the big frontrunner and is supposed to win. And Sanders is exploiting both anger with the GOP congress and some of the disappointment with Obama. So in some ways Sanders has a deeper well to draw from though he is coming from a much more extreme place than Dean and is facing a more capable, perhaps, adversary in Hillary.\"\n\nNow for more of the downside for Sanders.\n\nWhy is it that Tom Hayden himself isn't in this position to run for president? The short answer is that Hayden was too famous for his radicalism when he started out in electoral politics. While he liked to say that \"the radicalism of the '60s is the common sense of the '70s,\" that was not exactly right. And Hayden certainly wasn't sneaking up on anyone.\n\nThe long answer is that Sanders benefits from not being nearly so visible as Hayden in the '60s and '70s radical movements. His radicalism is not so well known. And when Hayden sought public office, he didn't go away to a little state to do it, he did it in the biggest state of all.\n\nI don't know if Sanders made as incendiary statements as Hayden did back in the day. (Though I suspect he made statements that won't fly today and bet the Republican opposition researchers already know about them.) If he did not, it's probably only because he didn't have the opportunity to do so, since he was not one of the national leaders of the movement.\n\nSanders also had the benefit of being able to fail repeatedly in a low-risk environment. Hayden, famous as he was, in California, married to Jane Fonda, had limited room for error. He couldn't afford to get six percent of the vote in statewide races as Sanders did before finally becoming mayor of tiny Burlington, Vermont, less than half the size of micro-people's republics in Santa Monica and Berkeley.\n\nWhen Hayden ran for the U.S. Senate, it was a big deal. And it was a big deal when he got a big primary vote in 1976, leading in the view of some to the crippling of incumbent Senator John Tunney, who went on to lose to Republican university president S.I. Hayakawa.\n\nThough Sanders had a more risk-free environment in Vermont, Hayden's struggles may yet prefigure long-term trouble for Sanders.\n\nBecause you know he said and wrote some radical things that may be hard to explain away.\n\nHayden certainly did. In fact, it nearly prevented him from winning elective office at all.\n\nHayden, a terrific writer, had gotten to know Jerry Brown early on, penning an excellent late 1974 Rolling Stone profile of the young California governor called \"The Mystic and the Machine\". A few years later, Hayden became a high-profile and useful part of the Brown administration, promoting renewable energy and energy conservation policies as chairman of SolarCal.\n\nSo Hayden had a mainstream record to run on when he sought a seat in the California Assembly in 1982. But the going proved to be extremely tough, even in one of the most liberal districts in the state on the West Side of Los Angeles.\n\nAfter a relatively narrow win in the Democratic primary -- despite being very well-financed by Fonda and a good fundraising base developed for his statewide Campaign for Economic Democracy organization -- Hayden received what might be described as a full visitation of the ghost of Christmas past. Voters were suddenly paying a lot of attention to billboards which sprung up all over the West Side emblazoned with incendiary Hayden quotes.\n\nThings like ... \"If blood is going to flow, let it flow all over this city - Tom Hayden.\" \"Property is theft - Tom Hayden.\" ... Like that. Maybe out of context, or not entirely accurate, they were nonetheless impossible to miss. It was so wild that it was funny. But it was also devastating, as it pointed to a not unlikely conclusion in which Hayden ended up seeming too much the illegitimate anti-American extremist even for a liberal Democratic district.\n\nThe late media maven Sidney Galanty prepared an excellent humanizing 60-second TV ad (which would air throughout the LA media market) in which Hayden talked about why he wasn't \"the same angry young man I used to be.\" But there was an ominous silence from many name Democrats.\n\nIn little-known Bill Hawkins, Hayden faced a very dangerous Republican opponent, a cipher, a man with no record to run against, one who espoused rather liberal views in tune with the district.\n\nSomething special needed to be done.\n\nDespite some past statements I would not have made, I knew that Hayden and Fonda, with whom I did not always agree, were not only not traitors, they were patriots. Patriots, that is, who in the white hot heat of the Vietnam War protests had done incredibly incautious things. I also knew that Hayden and Fonda had been among the most spied-upon of American citizens. (Dick Cheney began his Sith Lord duties, as Gerald Ford's deputy White House chief of staff 40 years ago, trying to shut down a New York Times story revealing that the CIA had violated its charter by spying on the anti-war movement here in America.)\n\nSo it only seemed fair that Hayden should at last get some spycraft working on his behalf.\n\nSitting in a rather morose meeting at Hayden's Santa Monica headquarters, surrounded by works from Fonda's blue-chip Pop Art collection, I had an idea. I would get Hayden's opponent on tape espousing policies directly contrary to what his campaign said his positions were. Posing as a Republican contributor, I was able to do just that.\n\nWhen the Hayden campaign finally revealed that Hawkins was simply lying about his positions -- I had gone on to do opposition research for LA Mayor Tom Bradley's near-miss (read: blown) campaign for governor -- the Republican's campaign was shocked and staggered.\n\n\n\nTom Hayden and Jane Fonda discussed their plans to travel here in the US and throughout Europe to expose Nixon's bombing of Hanoi and other Vietnam War moves in the early 1970s. Bernie Sanders was nowhere near as high-profile as that.\n\nIn normal circumstances, the race would have ended then and there. But, and here's the ominous point for Sanders and his enthusiasts, these were not normal circumstances. The campaign was not yet over. While Hawkins never recovered from the shock of revelation, Hayden still had to run flat out to convince enough voters that he was not too extreme to serve in public office.\n\nWith help from his new campaign chairman, revered former Governor Pat Brown -- who said: \"I'll take Tom Hayden over those phonies any day\" -- and some others, Hayden won by nine points in a district that normally went Democratic by a couple of times that. He spent what was then by far a national record amount for a state legislative race, $1.75 million. Hayden's opposition spent more than that, mostly in independent expenditures.\n\nIn subsequent elections, Hayden won by much more, though he had to win a squeaker over an incumbent to move to the Senate after his Assembly district was gutted in reapportionment. During 10 years in the state Assembly and eight years in the Senate before term limits caught up with him, Hayden proved a great champion of the clean energy path and other worthy things. But statewide office proved beyond his reach.\n\nNow, with regard to Sanders, there just might not be someone able to get whomever the Republican presidential nominee turns out to be to admit that he's really Darth Vader. And there's no widely-revered Pat Brown type figure on the national scene to reassure swing voters that Sanders is really a neat-o fellow despite all this crazy stuff you're hearing about him.\n\nIt's just four-and-a-half months before the voting starts in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Nevada and South Carolina rounding out the early spate of contests. Yet there is still plenty of time for many things to happen.\n\nFor example, we'll soon see if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race. My guess is no. Biden staying out helps Hillary, making it easier for her to retain more of the vote that is pleased with the Obama years.\n\nBut the fact that she's behind in Iowa and New Hampshire as the fall before the voting begins has to be alarming for the Clintons. No Democrat who has not won Iowa or New Hampshire has gone on to victory. Not that it can't be done, but that's not the sort of first a candidate heading to the White House is looking to garner.\n\nThere's clearly a growing rejection of the notion of accepting bland political mush, of settling for a politics which acquiesces in if it does not accelerate the further empowerment of the 0.1 percent and a future of unaccountable war stretching beyond the foreseeable horizon.\n\nI suspect the Clintons, once joined at the hip to Tony Blair and all too cognizant of his woes, know this. They might even be willing to do something about it. But is their credibility elastic enough to bounce back?\n\nFacebook comments are closed on this article.\n\nWilliam Bradley Archive"], ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/the-sanders-saga-why-is-a_b_8164596.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics", "The Sanders Saga: Why Is \"A Half-Baked Version of Tom Hayden\" Beating the Clintons?", "Last month, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders leading Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire primary polls and getting closer but still well behind in first-in-the-nation caucus state Iowa, I asked an old Clintonista how it could be that \"a half-baked version of Tom Hayden\" had a shot at beating the Clintons.

A government that fails to care for our men and women on the frontlines is guilty of malpractice. A government that puts the needs of illegal aliens above U.S. veterans for political gain should be prosecuted for criminal neglect bordering on treason.\n\nCompare, contrast and weep:\n\nIn Sacramento, Calif., lawmakers are moving forward with a budget-busting plan to extend government-funded health insurance to at least 1.5 million illegal aliens.\n\nIn Los Angeles, federal bureaucrats callously canceled an estimated 40,000 diagnostic tests and treatments for American veterans with cancer and other illnesses to cover up a decade-long backlog.\n\nIn New York, doctors report that nearly 40 percent of their patients receiving kidney dialysis are illegal aliens. A survey of nephrologists in 44 states revealed that 65 percent of them treat illegal aliens with kidney disease.\n\nIn Memphis, a VA whistleblower reported that his hospital was using contaminated kidney dialysis machines to treat America's warriors. The same hospital previously had been investigated for chronic overcrowding at its emergency room, leading to six-hour waits or longer. Another watchdog probe found unconscionable delays in processing lab tests at the center. In addition, three patients died under negligent circumstances, and the hospital failed to enforce accountability measures.\n\nIn Arizona, illegal aliens incurred health care costs totaling an estimated $700 million in 2009.\n\nIn Phoenix, at least 40 veterans died waiting for VA hospitals and clinics to treat them, while government officials created secret waiting lists to cook the books and deceive the public about deadly treatment delays.\n\nAt the University of California at Berkeley, UC President Janet Napolitano (former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security) has offered $5 million in financial aid to illegal alien students. Across the country, 16 states offer in-state tuition discounts for illegal aliens: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington. In addition, the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and the University of Michigan Board of Regents all approved their own illegal alien tuition benefits.\n\nIn 2013, the nation's most selective colleges and universities had enrolled just 168 American veterans, down from 232 in 2011. Anti-war activists have waged war on military recruitment offices at elite campuses for years. The huge influx of illegal aliens in state universities is shrinking the number of state-subsidized slots for vets.\n\nIn 2013, the Obama Department of Homeland Security released 36,007 known, convicted criminal illegal aliens, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.

In an open letter, Robinson explains why they shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nDear Pope Francis,\n\nI pray for you every day, because your pastoral responsibility is so daunting, and even if you are Pope, you are still only human. I have had the opportunity to be chief pastor and bishop to a faithful flock (albeit so very much smaller than yours), and it is an awesome responsibility. It is also a blessing and an honor to serve, is it not?\n\nThere has been a bit of a kerfuffle in the last 24 hours due to reports that a senior Vatican official is offended, on your behalf, by my invitation to the White House on Wednesday to welcome you to America. Sister Simone Campbell, one of the nuns working day in and day out on behalf of the poor, is lumped in with me as a purported offense to you.\n\nBased on your saintly ministry so far as Pope, I have to suspect that this report does not represent your own views (if this has even been brought to your attention), but rather the views of those who would try to \u201cprotect\u201d you from the world. It would seem that I hold a higher view of you than some of your handlers who may have forgotten that you have demonstrated quite regularly not only your knowledge of the real world, but also a compassion for it. Not to mention that the good nun and I will be somewhere in the middle of a throng of 10,000+ Americans joining together to welcome you and wish you well.\n\nI suppose the Vatican official\u2019s concern has to do with my having been elected and consecrated a Bishop of The Episcopal Church, while at the same time being an openly gay, partnered man. Were I ever to have the honor of meeting you, I would of course not be the first gay man or gay bishop with whom you have had contact. Some of them, undoubtedly, work with and for you in the Vatican. Based on your demonstrated and notorious compassion, I suspect you will not be offended by a gay bishop and a feisty nun somewhere in the crowd of 10,000 admirers.\n\nI am willing to acknowledge the saintly integrity with which you hold your views, even if I disagree with them, as I hope you might acknowledge my striving for integrity in mine.\n\nWe disagree in our understandings about sexuality and the diverse and wonderful ways God has made us. But as far as I am concerned, that does not keep me from admiring you and praying for you and your ministry.\n\nOur churches disagree on those whom we are willing to ordain, their gender and their sexual orientation. Still, that does not keep me from striving to love and serve those entrusted to me, and to pray for you as you strive to love and serve those entrusted to you. We both care passionately about the poor, and we share the notion that unfettered capitalism creates and perpetuates poverty, treating the less fortunate as goods to be used up and discarded.\n\nYou and I believe that God has a special place in God\u2019s heart for those who are marginalized\u2014whether they be refugees, undocumented immigrants, those living with HIV/AIDS, or those without food, shelter and healthcare. And we both suspect that God must wonder when we are going to find the courage to love and care for our beautiful and fragile planet.\n\nWe have so much that binds us together, and so little that separates us. We are probably never going to settle those differences. As for me, I am willing to acknowledge the saintly integrity with which you hold your views, even if I disagree with them, as I hope you might acknowledge my striving for integrity in mine. It seems that in these times, the greatest sin would be to write one another off and to stop caring about one another.\n\nThat, I think, would break God\u2019s heart.\n\nSomething tells me that you will not be offended if I am somewhere in the crowd of 10,000, gathered to welcome you to America, with respect and wholehearted affection. And I doubt that you need your colleagues in the Vatican to be so protective of you. We believe, you and I, that God loved us so much, God chose to become one of us, flesh and blood, incarnate. And that incarnation continues to raise humankind to new heights and calls us to serve all of God\u2019s children.\n\nI will be somewhere in that throng of people on the south lawn of the White House, welcoming you to America, and listening intently for what godly wisdom you might impart to us. Thank you for visiting us in America. And while members of your own flock will have a special joy in your visit, please know that many more of us respect your office and love you as a human being.\n\nA laborer in another part of the Vineyard,\n\nGene\n\nThe Rt.

Between 1966, when the television show \u201cStar Trek\u201d premiered, and 2013, when the movie \u201cStar Trek Into Darkness\u201d hit the screens, Nimoy portrayed the franchise\u2019s beloved first officer, Mr. Spock, in two TV series and eight films.\n\nAs he acknowledged, the key to \u201cStar Trek\u2019s\u201d longevity and cultural penetration was its seriousness of purpose, originally inspired by creator Gene Roddenberry\u2019s science-fiction vision. Modeled on \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels,\u201d the series was meant as an opportunity for social commentary, and it succeeded ingeniously, with episodes scripted by some of the era\u2019s finest science-fiction writers. Yet the development of \u201cStar Trek\u2019s\u201d moral and political tone over 50 years also traces the strange decline of American liberalism since the Kennedy era.\n\nCaptain Kirk and the Cold War Roddenberry and his colleagues were World War II veterans, whose country was now fighting the Cold War against a Communist aggressor they regarded with horror. They considered the Western democracies the only force holding back worldwide totalitarian dictatorship. The best expression of their spirit was John F. Kennedy\u2019s Inaugural Address, with its proud promise to \u201cpay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\u201d\n\nThis could have been declaimed by Captain James T. Kirk (played by William Shatner), of the starship U.S.S. Enterprise, who, as literature professor Paul Cantor observes in his essay \u201cShakespeare in the Original Klingon,\u201d is \u201ca Cold Warrior very much on the model of JFK.\u201d In episodes like \u201cThe Omega Glory,\u201d in which Kirk rapturously quotes the preamble to the Constitution, or \u201cFriday\u2019s Child,\u201d where he struggles to outwit the Klingons (stand-ins for the Soviet menace) in negotiations over the resources of a planet modeled on Middle Eastern petroleum states, Kirk stands fixedly, even obstinately, for the principles of universal freedom and against collectivism, ignorance, and passivity.\n\nKirk loves peace, but he recognizes that peace without freedom is not truly peace. In \u201cErrand of Mercy,\u201d the episode that first introduces the show\u2019s most infamous villains, he cannot comprehend why the placid Organians are willing to let themselves be enslaved by the Klingon Empire. Their pacifism disgusts him. Kirk loves peace, but he recognizes that peace without freedom is not truly peace.\n\nThis was not just a political point; it rested on a deeper philosophical commitment. In \u201cStar Trek\u2019s\u201d humanist vision, totalitarianism was only one manifestation of the dehumanizing forces that deprive mankind (and aliens) of the opportunities and challenges in which their existence finds meaning.\n\nFor Freedom of Choice In \u201cReturn of the Archons,\u201d for example, Kirk and company infiltrate a theocratic world monitored and dominated by the god Landru. The natives are placid, but theirs is the mindless placidity of cattle. In the past, one explains, \u201cthere was war. Convulsions. The world was destroying itself. Landru\u2026took us back, back to a simple time.\u201d The people now live in ignorant, stagnant bliss. Landru has removed conflict by depriving them of responsibility, and with it their right to govern themselves.\n\nLandru has removed conflict by depriving them of responsibility, and with it their right to govern themselves. When Kirk discovers that Landru is actually an ancient computer left behind by an extinct race, he challenges it to justify its enslavement of the people. \u201cThe good,\u201d it answers, is \u201charmonious continuation\u2026peace, tranquility.\u201d Kirk retorts: \u201cWhat have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual? Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity. Without creativity, there is no life.\u201d He persuades Landru that coddling the people has stifled the souls it purported to defend, and the god-machine self-destructs.\n\nThis theme is made more explicit in \u201cThe Apple,\u201d perhaps the quintessential episode of the original Star Trek. Here Kirk unashamedly violates the \u201cPrime Directive\u201d\u2014the rule forbidding starship captains from interfering with the cultures they contact\u2014by ordering the Enterprise to destroy Vaal, another computer tyrant ruling over an idyllic planet.\n\nLike Landru, Vaal is an omniscient totalitarian, and he demands sacrifices. The natives, known only as \u201cpeople of Vaal,\u201d have no culture, no freedom, no science\u2014they do not even know how to farm\u2014and no children, as Vaal has forbidden sex along with all other individualistic impulses. This sets Kirk\u2019s teeth on edge. There are objective goods and evils, and slavery is evil because it deprives life forms of their right to self-government and self-development.\n\nKirk believes there must be deeper, universal principles underlying and limiting diversity, to prevent its degeneration into relativism and nihilism. What differentiates \u201cThe Apple\u201d from \u201cArchons\u201d is Spock\u2019s reaction. In the earlier episode, he joined Kirk in condemning Landru; now the half human/half Vulcan is reluctant to interfere with what he calls \u201ca splendid example of reciprocity.\u201d When chief medical officer Leonard \u201cBones\u201d McCoy (DeForest Kelley) protests, Spock accuses him of \u201capplying human standards to non-human cultures.\u201d To this cool relativism, McCoy replies, \u201cThere are certain absolutes, Mr. Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment, the right to have conditions which permit growth.\u201d\n\nKirk agrees with McCoy. Spock\u2014who in later episodes invokes the Vulcan slogan celebrating \u201cinfinite diversity in infinite combinations\u201d\u2014is comfortable observing Vaal\u2019s servants nonjudgmentally, like specimens behind glass. But Kirk believes there must be deeper, universal principles underlying and limiting diversity, to prevent its degeneration into relativism and nihilism.\n\nSpock\u2019s Relative Hesitation This is an insight Kirk shares with Abraham Lincoln, who\u2014as we learn in a later episode\u2014is Kirk\u2019s personal hero. When in 1858 Stephen Douglas claimed to be so committed to democracy that he did not care whether American states and territories adopted pro- or anti-slavery constitutions, Lincoln parodied his relativism as meaning \u201cthat if one man would enslave another, no third man should object.\u201d Instead, Lincoln insisted, the basis of legitimate democracy was the principle of equality articulated in the Declaration of Independence. Without that frame firmly in place, democracy could claim no moral superiority to tyranny.\n\nRoddenberry\u2019s generation emerged from World War II committed to a liberalism that believed in prosperity, technological progress, and universal humanity. Spock, by regarding this as a merely \u201chuman standard,\u201d and defending Vaal\u2019s suzerainty as \u201ca system which seems to work,\u201d falls into the same relativistic trap as Douglas. By contrast, as Paul Cantor notes, Kirk believes \u201cthat all rational beings are created equal,\u201d and extends the Declaration\u2019s proposition \u201cliterally throughout the universe.\u201d Kirk orders the Enterprise to destroy Vaal. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn to care for yourselves,\u201d he tells the people. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn to build for yourselves, think for yourselves, work for yourselves, and what you create is yours. That\u2019s what we call freedom.\u201d\n\nSpock\u2019s hesitation here is an early glimmer of the relativism that would eventually engulf the \u201cStar Trek\u201d universe. Roddenberry\u2019s generation emerged from World War II committed to a liberalism that believed in prosperity, technological progress, and the universal humanity they hoped the United Nations would champion. In the Kennedy years, this technocratic liberalism sought to apply science, the welfare state, and secular culture to raise the standard of living and foster individual happiness worldwide.\n\nSearching for an Impossible Eden Then came the rise of the New Left\u2014a movement that saw the alleged evils of society as the consequence not merely of capitalism but of technology and reason itself. Civilization was not the perfection of nature or even a protection against nature, but an alienation from nature. Throw off its shackles, and man could reunite with the universe; unfairness would fall away, and peaceful coexistence would reign.\n\nThe war in Vietnam and other crises helped foster a debunking culture that saw American principles of justice as a sham, as cynical rationalizations for American greed, racism, and imperialism. \u201cPeaceful coexistence\u201d was especially crucial. The war in Vietnam and other crises helped foster a debunking culture that saw American principles of justice as a sham, as cynical rationalizations for American greed, racism, and imperialism. The older generation of liberals\u2014and their literary proxies, including Captain Kirk\u2014hardly knew what to make of it, or of the \u201cturn on, tune in, drop out\u201d escapism that often accompanied it.\n\nThe original Star Trek savagely parodied such Age of Aquarius romanticism in the episode \u201cThe Way to Eden,\u201d in which the Enterprise encounters a group of space-age hippies searching for a legendary planet where all will be equal, without technology or modernity, living off the land. Almost all of Kirk\u2019s crew regard these star-children as deluded, and their longing for prelapsarian harmony does turn out to be a deadly illusion: the Eden planet they find is literally poison\u2014all the trees and even the grass are full of an acid that kills them almost the instant they arrive. Kirk is hardly surprised. All Edens, in his eyes, are illusions, and all illusions are dangerous.\n\nSpock is more indulgent. \u201cThere are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created,\u201d he tells the captain, \u201cthe planned communities, the programming, the sterilized, artfully balanced atmospheres.\u201d Spock insists he does not share their views, yet he secretly admires them, and devotes his considerable scientific skills to helping locate their paradise planet. Later, he tells one of the few survivors of the acid, \u201cIt is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden. I have no doubt but that you will find it, or make it yourselves.\u201d The skeptical, spirited Kirk could never utter such words.\n\nTale of Two Hamlets Kirk, it turns out, has personal reasons for his skepticism. In \u201cThe Conscience of the King,\u201d we learn that he is something of a Holocaust survivor himself. When he was young, he and his parents barely escaped death at the hands of the dictator Kodos the Executioner, who slaughtered half the population of the colony on Tarsus IV. Having eluded capture, Kodos lived 20 years under an assumed name, making a living as a Shakespearean actor, until one of Kirk\u2019s fellow survivors tracks him down. Now Kirk must decide whether the actor is really the killer.\n\nFor Shakespeare, justice is less about the good prospering and the bad suffering than about a harmony between the world of facts in which we live and the world of words we inhabit. Aired in 1966, this episode is a commentary on the pursuit of Nazi war criminals, and it typifies the original Star Trek\u2019s moral outlook. During the show\u2019s three seasons, more than 20 former Nazis were tried for their roles in the Holocaust, including five who only two weeks after this episode aired were convicted for working at the Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp. Intellectuals like Hannah Arendt were preoccupied with the moral and jurisprudential questions of Nazi-hunting. \u201cConscience\u201d puts these dilemmas into an ambitiously Shakespearean frame.\n\nLike Hamlet, Kirk faces a crisis of certainty. \u201cLogic is not enough,\u201d he says, echoing Hamlet\u2019s \u201cWhat a rogue and peasant slave am I\u201d soliloquy. \u201cI\u2019ve got to feel my way\u2014make absolutely sure.\u201d Yet one thing Kirk is already sure about is justice. Hamlet may curse that he was ever born to set things right, but he knows it is his duty. Likewise Kirk. When McCoy asks him what good it will do to punish Kodos after a lapse of two decades\u2014\u201cDo you play god, carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won\u2019t bring back the dead\u201d\u2014Kirk answers, \u201cNo. But they may rest easier.\u201d\n\nFor Shakespeare, justice is less about the good prospering and the bad suffering than about a harmony between the world of facts in which we live and the world of words we inhabit as beings endowed with speech. When the two fall out of sync\u2014when Claudius\u2019s crime knocks time \u201cout of joint\u201d\u2014the result is only a perverse and temporary illusion. And Kirk is, again, not impressed by illusions. \u201cWho are you to [judge]?\u201d demands Kodos\u2019s daughter. Kirk\u2019s devastating reply: \u201cWho do I have to be?\u201d\n\nInverting \u201cStar Trek\u2019s\u201d Original Liberalism This clear-headedness had evaporated by December 1991, when the movie sequel \u201cStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\u201d appeared, only months after Roddenberry\u2019s death. The previous films had focused on questions of loyalty, friendship, and Spock\u2019s need for feeling to leaven his logic, but this one, written in part by Nimoy, would be the first devoted expressly to political subjects. It comments on the waning of the Cold War by portraying the first steps toward peace with the Klingons. Yet the price of peace, it turns out, is not merely to forgive past crimes, but for the innocent peoples of the galaxy to take the guilt upon themselves.\n\nThe price of peace, it turns out, is not merely to forgive past crimes, but for the innocent peoples of the galaxy to take the guilt upon themselves. \u201cStar Trek VI\u201d opens with a shocking betrayal: without informing his captain, Spock has volunteered the crew for a peace mission to the Klingons. Kirk rightly calls this \u201carrogant presumption,\u201d yet the Vulcan is never expected to apologize.\n\nOn the contrary, the film summarily silences Kirk\u2019s objections. At a banquet aboard the Enterprise, he is asked whether he would be willing to surrender his career in exchange for an end to hostilities, and Spock swiftly intervenes. \u201cI believe the captain feels that Starfleet\u2019s mission has always been one of peace,\u201d he says. Kirk tries to disagree, but is again interrupted. Later, he decides that \u201cSpock was right.\u201d His original skepticism toward the peace mission was only prejudice: \u201cI was used to hating Klingons.\u201d\n\nThis represented an almost complete inversion of \u201cStar Trek\u2019s\u201d original liberalism, and indeed of any rational scale of moral principles at all. At no point in the show\u2019s history had Kirk or his colleagues treated the Klingons unjustly, whereas audiences for decades have watched the Klingons torment and subjugate the galaxy\u2019s peaceful races.\n\nIn \u201cErrand of Mercy,\u201d they attempt genocide to enslave the Organians. In \u201cThe Trouble with Tribbles,\u201d they try to poison a planet\u2019s entire food supply. The dungeon in which Kirk is imprisoned in this film is on a par with Stalin\u2019s jails. Yet never does the Klingon leader, Gorkon, or any of his people, acknowledge\u2014let alone apologize for\u2014such injustices. Quite the contrary; his daughter tells a galactic conference, \u201cWe are a proud race. We are here because we want to go on being proud.\u201d Within the context of the original \u201cStar Trek,\u201d such pride is morally insane.\n\nKirk can hardly be blamed for withholding forgiveness, considering that the Klingons have never asked for it. Yet in service to Spock\u2019s mission of elevating peace over right, the film portrays the Klingons not as thugs, but as misunderstood casualties of human bigotry. Kirk and his crew, says Gorkon\u2019s daughter at the Enterprise banquet, represent a \u201chomo sapiens-only club,\u201d devoted to such chauvinistic values as \u201cinalienable human rights.\u201d \u201cWhy, the very name,\u201d she quips, \u201cis racist.\u201d Gorkon\u2019s pacific overtures are stymied by conspirators who assassinate him, and while pursuing the murderers, Kirk decides that he, too, is at fault\u2014because he has not simply let bygones be bygones.\n\nAbashed, he confesses, \u201cI couldn\u2019t get past the death of my son\u201d\u2014a reference to an earlier film in which a Klingon crew stabs his son to death in an effort to extort the secret of a devastating weapon. Kirk can hardly be blamed for withholding forgiveness, considering that the Klingons have never asked for it. Yet \u201cStar Trek VI\u201d demands that Kirk let go of his grievances\u2014and the galaxy\u2019s\u2014unasked, and accept that they will forever go unredressed. Justice is only a human cultural construct.\n\nThere Is Nothing to Forgive The contrast with \u201cConscience of the King\u201d is jarring. It even affects the many Shakespearean references that pepper both dramas. For the orthodox bard, repentance is always a precondition of forgiveness, and conscience is the inescapable enforcer of natural law.\n\nKirk learns not only to suffer slings and arrows, but to cease calling it outrageous. Thus in \u201cConscience,\u201d Shakespeare\u2019s meditations illuminated Kirk\u2019s thoughts on guilt and judgment. But in the film, the poet is quoted only to obfuscate. \u201cStar Trek VI\u201d even twists Shakespeare\u2019s actual words. The \u201cUndiscovered Country\u201d of the title\u2014to which Gorkon proposes a toast at the banquet\u2014is not, as he claims, \u201cthe future,\u201d but Hamlet\u2019s metaphor for death. \u201c\u2018To be or not to be,\u2019 that is the question which preoccupies our people,\u201d another Klingon tells Kirk.\n\nYet where Hamlet sought the resolve to take up arms against a sea of troubles, Kirk learns not only to suffer slings and arrows, but to cease calling it outrageous. When he does, Gorkon\u2019s daughter congratulates him for having \u201crestored\u201d her father\u2019s \u201cfaith.\u201d But Kirk is a victim of Klingon aggression\u2014he needs no redemption.\n\nRoddenberry was so bothered by the film\u2019s script that he angrily confronted director Nicholas Meyer at a meeting, futilely demanding changes. He and those who helped him create \u201cStar Trek\u201d knew that without a coherent moral code\u2014ideas they considered universal, but which the film calls \u201cracist\u201d\u2014one can never have genuine peace. \u201cStar Trek VI\u201d seemed to nod contentedly at the haunting thought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn voiced in \u201cThe Gulag Archipelago\u201d: \u201cNo, no one would have to answer.\u201d\n\nNext-Generation Nihilism This moral weariness highlighted the moral disarray into which the franchise had fallen. By 1987, when the new Enterprise was being launched on the new series \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation,\u201d the liberal landscape had changed.\n\nTime and again, the show featured false equivalency on a grand scale. The show premiered a year after feminist philosopher of science Sandra Harding referred to Newton\u2019s \u201cPrincipia\u201d as a \u201crape manual,\u201d and a year before Jesse Jackson led Stanford student protesters chanting, \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, Western Civ has got to go!\u201d The Kennedy-esque anti-Communist in the White House was now Ronald Reagan, a former Democrat and union leader who thought the party had left him.\n\n\u201cNext Generation\u2019s\u201d Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) was more committed to coexistence and non-intervention than to universal liberty and anti-totalitarianism. Following Spock\u2019s lead, Picard would elevate the Prime Directive into a morally obtuse dogma and would seek ways to evade the responsibility of moral judgment. Time and again, the show featured false equivalency on a grand scale, coupled with the hands-off attitude that the Kirk of \u201cThe Apple\u201d had dismissed as complicity with evil.\n\nConsider the episode \u201cRedemption.\u201d Picard has overseen the installation of Gowron as chief of the Klingon Empire, a decision that, although unorthodox, follows Klingon law. The empire, now humanity\u2019s ally, had invited Picard to judge the leadership controversy, and the Enterprise\u2019s Klingon crewman, Mr. Worf (Michael Dorn), has even resigned to join Gowron\u2019s crew. But at just this moment, rivals to the throne revolt and attack Gowron\u2019s ship in full view of the Enterprise.\n\nIn \u201cStar Trek VI,\u201d Kirk nearly gave his life trying to prevent the assassination of the Klingon chancellor, but Picard, rather than defend the lawful leader of an ally against a revolt of which he had been forewarned\u2014and which takes place in his presence\u2014chooses to abandon Gowron, and his friend and shipmate Worf. He orders the Enterprise to withdraw, rather than be drawn into a battle his own actions helped precipitate.\n\nWhen it comes to the universe of real suffering, real need, and a real search for truth, he is content not to decide, not to take responsibility, and not to know. If that were not enough, Gowron\u2014who manages to survive this fickleness\u2014requests aid against the rebels, whom they all know to have been collaborating with the Romulans, deadly enemies of both the Klingons and humans. Yet Picard again refuses, citing the non-interference directive that Gowron has already waived by requesting assistance. Picard, the Klingons learn, is not a very valuable friend.\n\nWhat accounts for this incoherent foreign policy? Nothing less than Picard\u2019s commitment to non-commitment. He represents a new, non-judgmental liberalism far shallower than that embraced in Roddenberry\u2019s era. Where Kirk pursues justice, Picard avoids conflict. Just as Kirk\u2019s devotion to universal principles goes deeper than politics, so does Picard\u2019s sentimentalism. When it comes to the universe of real suffering, real need, and a real search for truth, he is content not to decide, not to take responsibility, and not to know.\n\nFull-Blown Insurrection If \u201cThe Apple,\u201d was the perfect expression of the older \u201cStar Trek,\u201d the culminating moment in Next Generation is the 1998 feature film, \u201cInsurrection.\u201d It opens with Picard lamenting that he\u2019s been relegated to boring diplomatic roles. \u201cCan anyone remember when we used to be explorers?\u201d he grumbles.\n\nBut soon he learns better. The Enterprise crew is introduced to the Ba\u2019ku people, who live in the kind of agrarian idyll that the space hippies had sought in \u201cThe Way to Eden.\u201d Although filmed like a Crate & Barrel ad and scored with pastoral melodies, the Ba\u2019kus\u2019 village is shockingly primitive. They rake, plow, weed, and blacksmith by hand\u2014not because they don\u2019t know better, but because they reject modern devices: \u201cThis village is a sanctuary of life,\u201d one of them, Sojef, tells Picard:\n\nOur technological abilities are not apparent because we have chosen not to employ them in our daily lives. We believe when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something away from the man.\n\n\n\nAnij: But at one time, we explored the galaxy just as you do\u2026\n\n\n\nPicard: You have warp capability?\n\n\n\nAnij: Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here?\n\nThe Ba\u2019ku would have nauseated Captain Kirk. Here is a species that lives \u201cThe Apple\u201d not as captives but as willing participants. They have given up growth for stagnation, which they have mistaken for life. Yet the audience is expected to admire this. From this meeting, Picard learns not to long for his days exploring strange new worlds.\n\nIn a denouement ultimately cut from the film, Picard encounters Quark (Armin Shimerman), a member of the Ferengi, a race of greedy capitalists. Now that the Ba\u2019ku are safe, Quark fantasizes about developing their home planet. Picard fends him off. \u201cThis world is about to become a Federation protectorate,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich will end any and all attempts at exploitation by people like you.\u201d\n\nThey have given up growth for stagnation, which they have mistaken for life. Let\u2019s ignore the whiff of racism in the phrase \u201cpeople like you\u201d\u2014when Quark asks \u201chow five thousand time-share units\u2026right there along the lake, would be \u2018exploiting\u2019 anyone,\u201d it is a perfectly reasonable question. But Picard snidely laughs it off, and, turning to the Ba\u2019ku, tells them that \u201cThe \u2018mighty\u2019 Federation could learn a few things from this village.\u201d\n\nWhat, Kirk would have demanded, could the Federation possibly learn from this village? A village that has chosen not to explore, that has rejected modern agricultural methods, that has given up growth and life in exchange for an absurd fetishizing of manual labor\u2014for the fundamentally childish notion that you \u201ctake something\u201d from people when you create tools and techniques that feed the hungry and liberate people to explore the galaxy.\n\nRoddenberry\u2019s generation of \u201cStar Trek\u201d writers would have thought Picard\u2019s words hopelessly reactionary\u2014to be precise, inhuman. But by the end of \u201cNext Generation,\u201d the liberalism that once preached technological progress and human reason has reversed its priorities and now regards \u201cprogress\u201d as incipient colonization and a threat to diversity and the environment.\n\nFrom Principles to Physical Urges \u201cStar Trek\u2019s\u201d latest iterations\u2014the \u201creboot\u201d films directed by J.J. Abrams\u2014shrug at the franchise\u2019s former philosophical depth. In 2009, Abrams admitted to an interviewer that he \u201cdidn\u2019t get\u201d \u201cStar Trek.\u201d \u201cThere was a captain, there was this first officer, they were talking a lot about adventures and not having them as much as I would\u2019ve liked. Maybe I wasn\u2019t smart enough.\u201d His films accordingly eschew the series\u2019 trademark dialogues about moral and political principles, and portray the young Kirk and crew as motivated largely by a maelstrom of lusts, fears, and resentments.\n\nJ. J. Abram\u2019s films portray the young Kirk and crew as motivated largely by a maelstrom of lusts, fears, and resentments. A prime symbol of this transformation is Khan, the villain who appeared first in the 1967 episode \u201cSpace Seed,\u201d then in the second \u201cStar Trek\u201d film in 1982 (played both times by Ricardo Montalban), and most recently in Abrams\u2019s 2013 \u201cStar Trek Into Darkness\u201d (in which he was portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch).\n\nKhan presents a serious challenge to the series\u2019 liberal conception of equality because he is a genetically modified superman. As the late Harry V. Jaffa was fond of observing, Aristotle\u2019s distinction between men, beasts, and gods \u201cremains the framework of the thought of the Declaration of Independence,\u201d according to which \u201cany attempt of human beings to rule other human beings, as if the former were gods, and the latter beasts, is wrong.\u201d But Khan actually is more than a man, which raises a serious problem for mankind\u2019s right to liberty.\n\nIn the original TV show\u2019s episode, and somewhat against his grain, it is Spock who addresses the issue. When Kirk calls Khan \u201cthe best of the tyrants,\u201d Spock is appalled:\n\nSpock: Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is\u2014\n\n\n\nKirk: Mister Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us. Appalling, but there, nevertheless.\n\n\n\nScotty: There were no massacres under his rule.\n\n\n\nSpock: And as little freedom.\n\nKirk finally explains, \u201cWe can be against him and admire him all at the same time,\u201d which Spock characterizes as \u201cillogical.\u201d In the end, the crew refuses to submit to Khan\u2019s assertion of a eugenic right to rule. Yet they also choose not to punish him even after he tries to kill Kirk and commandeer the Enterprise.\n\nInstead, they leave him and his followers on an unpopulated planet, where he can put his talents to work pioneering a new civilization. Fifteen years later, we learn in the film \u201cStar Trek II\u201d that the planet was devastated by a natural disaster soon afterwards, killing many of Khan\u2019s followers. Obsessed with revenge, Khan manages to escape and, like a space-age Ahab, hunts the aging Kirk. Only by sacrificing his life does Spock save his shipmates.\n\nGovernment by Accident and Force By the time Khan reappears under Abrams\u2019s direction, the fixed moral stars by which the franchise once steered have been almost entirely obscured. No longer the thoughtful, bold captain, the young Kirk (Chris Pine) is now all rashness and violence, taking and breaking everything around him. He confesses that he has no idea what he is doing.\n\nAbrams grounds Kirk\u2019s authority not on practical wisdom or merit, but on a version of the swaggering pretension to inherent superiority that \u2018Space Seed\u2019 had repudiated. But these are not vices he outgrows. Instead, the other characters come to recognize these traits as proof of his entitlement to command. When, in Abrams\u2019s first film, Kirk\u2019s recklessness briefly costs him his ship, his reign is restored by the intercession of an older version of Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy, who journeys across the dimensions to counsel Kirk that it is still his \u201cdestiny\u201d to lead. \u201c[T]his is the one rule you cannot break,\u201d Nimoy intones, without further explanation.\n\nKirk proceeds to retake control of the Enterprise in brutal fashion. Abrams thus grounds Kirk\u2019s authority not on practical wisdom or merit, which he expressly disclaims, but on a version of the swaggering pretension to inherent superiority that \u201cSpace Seed\u201d had repudiated. The new Enterprise is governed more by what \u201cThe Federalist\u201d calls \u201caccident and force\u201d than by \u201creflection and choice.\u201d\n\nThis creates a paradox when the crew encounters Khan in \u201cInto Darkness.\u201d Dispatched to arrest the perpetrator of a terrorist attack, Kirk learns it is Khan\u2014\u201cgenetically engineered to be superior so as to lead others to peace in a world at war,\u201d Khan explains\u2014and that earth\u2019s current military leadership were secretly employing him as a military strategist. \u201cI am better,\u201d Khan says, at \u201ceverything.\u201d\n\nBut this is how Kirk, too, is depicted\u2014as destined to command just because he is \u201cbetter.\u201d \u201c[I]f Khan and Kirk have the same motivation,\u201d asked critic Abigail Nussbaum, \u201cwhy is one of them the bad guy and the other the hero?\u201d\n\nUltimately, Khan is presented as evil not because he wars against equality and freedom, but because he isn\u2019t one of us, while Kirk is\u2014and because he loses, while Kirk wins. The film acknowledges the similarities between the two, and even enlists the audience\u2019s sympathy for Khan\u2019s terrorism\u2014but it never answers this question, except in terms of personal loyalty and betrayal. In an effort at ratio ex machina, Nimoy is once again brought in as Spock, to tell the crew that Khan is \u201cdangerous\u201d\u2014but even he gives the audience no reason to consider Khan a villain.\n\nUltimately, Khan is presented as evil not because he wars against equality and freedom, but because he isn\u2019t one of us, while Kirk is\u2014and because he loses, while Kirk wins. This arbitrariness infects the film\u2019s single effort to express an abstract principle: \u201cOur first instinct is to seek revenge when those we love are taken,\u201d says Kirk in the final scene. \u201cBut that\u2019s not who we are.\u201d We are not told why not, beyond this tribalistic assertion. But it is who Khan is, and he is better at everything. Doesn\u2019t that make vengeance right?\n\nHaving lost their principles, the show\u2019s heroes cannot really explain, or understand, what differentiates them from their enemies, and so are rendered vulnerable to the very forces they once opposed. That Nimoy was recruited to bless this arrangement on behalf of \u201cStar Trek\u2019s\u201d older generation is perverse.\n\nBut that perversity is the natural consequence of the breakdown in the liberal principles that once guided the series. \u201cStar Trek\u2019s\u201d romance with relativism gradually blotted them out until the franchise came to prize feeling over thought, image over substance, and immediate gratification over moral and political responsibility. What was once an expression of the Enlightenment faded \u201cinto darkness.\u201d\n\nOver nearly 50 years, \u201cStar Trek\u201d tracked the devolution of liberalism from the philosophy of the New Frontier into a preference for non-judgmental diversity and reactionary hostility to innovation, and finally into an almost nihilistic collection of divergent urges. At its best, \u201cStar Trek\u201d talked about big ideas, in a big way. Its decline reflects a culture-wide change in how Americans have thought about the biggest idea of all: mankind\u2019s place in the universe."], ["http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/09/gop-debate-vaccines-trump-carson-paul", "Last Night's Republican Debate Was Literally a Public Health Risk", "At Wednesday night's debate, GOP front-runner Donald Trump once again repeated the totally discredited\u2014and incredibly dangerous\u2014theory that vaccines cause autism. You can watch it above. Basically, everything Trump said about vaccines was wrong. A lot of what his opponents said was wrong, too.\n\nWhat's more, this barrage of misinformation appears to have caused a massive increase in Google searches about the supposed vaccine-autism connection. The spike on the Google Trends chart below occurred shortly after the exchange:\n\n\"Autism has become an epidemic,\" Trump claimed. \"Twenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close. It has gotten totally out of control.\" Scientists dispute this: While it's true that autism diagnoses have risen, a recent study suggested that the number of children with autism symptoms has remained stable. In other words, autism may not be getting more common; we're just diagnosing it more often.\n\n\"I am totally in favor of vaccines,\" Trump insisted, before adding, \"but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time\u2026I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two- or three-year period of time. Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump\u2014I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child, and we've had so many instances, people that work for me. Just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\" By spreading out the vaccine schedule, Trump concluded, \"I think you're going to see a big impact on autism.\"\n\nVaccines do not cause autism. Spreading out vaccines over a longer time period won't make anyone safer, but it will put more children at risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, as my colleague Kiera Butler has explained. And those diseases can be deadly. \"When you delay vaccines, you increase the period of time in which you are susceptible to those diseases,\" vaccine expert Paul Offit told the New York Times Thursday. \"We are seeing the effects of that. The outbreak we saw this year in Southern California was among parents who had chosen to delay or withheld vaccines for their children.\"\n\nTwo of Trump's Republican rivals are doctors, but unfortunately they didn't clear up the issue.\n\n\"We have extremely well-documented proof that there's no autism associated with vaccinations,\" explained Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon. But, he added, \"it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.\"\n\nNo, it's not true.\n\n\"I'm all for vaccines, but I'm also for freedom,\" said Rand Paul, a former ophthalmologist. \"I'm also a little concerned about how they're bunched up. My kids had all of their vaccines, and even if the science doesn't say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to have the right to spread my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.\" Paul, who has previously suggested that vaccines can cause \"profound mental disorders,\" has been an outspoken opponent of proposals to strengthen vaccination mandates.\n\nFor his part, moderator Jake Tapper noted that \"the medical community adamantly disputes\" Trump's ideas about vaccines. But it's fair to assume that many people confused by this exchange immediately turned to the internet for more information. Fortunately, Google's top search results debunk Trump's theories, but you don't have to dig very far to find a number of websites promoting the vaccine-autism myth. After all, notorious vaccine critic Jenny McCarthy once explained that she began learning about autism at the \"University of Google.\""], ["http://townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/2014/05/23/how-america-treats-illegal-aliens-vs-veterans-n1842227/page/full", "How America Treats Illegal Aliens vs. Veterans", "A government that fails to secure its borders is guilty of dereliction of duty. A government that fails to care for our men and women on the frontlines is guilty of malpractice. A government that puts the needs of illegal aliens above U.S. veterans for political gain should be prosecuted for criminal neglect bordering on treason.\n\nCompare, contrast and weep:\n\nIn Sacramento, Calif., lawmakers are moving forward with a budget-busting plan to extend government-funded health insurance to at least 1.5 million illegal aliens.\n\nIn Los Angeles, federal bureaucrats callously canceled an estimated 40,000 diagnostic tests and treatments for American veterans with cancer and other illnesses to cover up a decade-long backlog.\n\nIn New York, doctors report that nearly 40 percent of their patients receiving kidney dialysis are illegal aliens. A survey of nephrologists in 44 states revealed that 65 percent of them treat illegal aliens with kidney disease.\n\nIn Memphis, a VA whistleblower reported that his hospital was using contaminated kidney dialysis machines to treat America's warriors. The same hospital previously had been investigated for chronic overcrowding at its emergency room, leading to six-hour waits or longer. Another watchdog probe found unconscionable delays in processing lab tests at the center. In addition, three patients died under negligent circumstances, and the hospital failed to enforce accountability measures.\n\nIn Arizona, illegal aliens incurred health care costs totaling an estimated $700 million in 2009.\n\nIn Phoenix, at least 40 veterans died waiting for VA hospitals and clinics to treat them, while government officials created secret waiting lists to cook the books and deceive the public about deadly treatment delays.\n\nAt the University of California at Berkeley, UC President Janet Napolitano (former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security) has offered $5 million in financial aid to illegal alien students. Across the country, 16 states offer in-state tuition discounts for illegal aliens: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington. In addition, the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and the University of Michigan Board of Regents all approved their own illegal alien tuition benefits.\n\nIn 2013, the nation's most selective colleges and universities had enrolled just 168 American veterans, down from 232 in 2011. Anti-war activists have waged war on military recruitment offices at elite campuses for years. The huge influx of illegal aliens in state universities is shrinking the number of state-subsidized slots for vets.\n\nIn 2013, the Obama Department of Homeland Security released 36,007 known, convicted criminal illegal aliens, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.

Okay, let's back up.Aah! Did you just say spokesmaninstead of spokesperson when womenare just as capable of selling sandwichesas anyone?! Are you purposelytrying to use words that assertyour male privilege?! No, I'm sorry! I was just trying to frame youfor raping Butters! Do you think Italian-Americansand women are less important?! Oh, God! You dare to use wordsthat alienate two communities of peoplewho have to deal\n\n[Bleep] yeah! [ Indistinct conversations ] Can I speakwith P.C. Principal, please?

We're excitedyou want to try and be P.C. We hopeyou've got what it takes to join the most socially activegroup in America. Whooo!Whooo!Whooo!Whooo! You know, there's stillsome people out there that say, \"What does being P.C.really mean?\" Well, I'll tell youwhat it means. It means you love nothing morethan beer, working out, and that feeling you getwhen you rhetorically defend a marginalized communityfrom systems of oppression. -Whoo!-Yeah, yeah, yeah! -Dude, let's go!-Whoo, whoo! -Yeah!-Yeah! -Whoo-hooo!-Whoo-hooo! Whooo! -Whoo-hoo!-Let's go! Yeah! [ Groaning ] [ Sighs ] You got home pretty latelast night. 6:00 a.m.? I've joineda social-awareness group. It's a coalition thatdiscourages the use of...words that have negativeor offensive connotations to grant respect to people who are victimsof unfair stereotypes. You got in at 6:00,and now you're missing work. We've been getting awaywith horrible things, Sharon. Having laughsat less privileged people and thinkingit was harmless. Our group is...trying to bea civilizing influence, where we discussand have meetings to better defineand reinforce tolerance and acceptanceof all groups of people. Hm. And do they have boozeat these meetings? Uh... They serve refreshments,yes.\n\nCartman? We can't beat him,you guys. P.C. Principalis too strong. What do we do now? There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admitI did something wrong, take my punishmentand move on. I'm not Tom Brady. Oh, no! Dude, if we all tell the policewhat the principal did, -he'll be fired.-Yeah! -No way.-Why? Because P.C. Principalis right, Kyle. You and I are bigots. And it's timefor us to grow up. No, you're a bigot. If I can face my prejudice,why can't you? We're two privileged,straight white boys have their laughs about thingswe never had to deal with. I'm notgoing to apologize for saying Caitlyn Jennerisn't a hero. In fact, personally, I think she's most likelynot a very good person. [ All gasp ] Aah! Aah! Kyle, believe me,I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselvesbetter people...together. Come on, fat-ass. No more fat shaming, Kyle.Let's start a new chapter. So you're never gonna call mea dirty Jew again? No. I'm going to call you...my friend. Oh [bleep] you. I guess we never realizedhow bad he really was.\n\nP.C. PRINCIPAL:All right, pledges, listen up. Congratulations on making itto the final cuts. -Whoo!-Yeah! -Dude, let's go!-Whoo-hoo! Now it's timefor the final test. So, what you're gonna have to doto prove you belong with P.C. is go out thereand check someone's privilege. Finally! Yes! I'm sorry,I don't know what that is. Tofer, can you explaincheck your privilege, please? It's getting someoneto acknowledge their owninherent privileges, and reminding themto put them aside in order to better understandanother human's plight. You see,there's still people out there like Brett [bleep] Favre, who thinkthat when we all stand up and applaud Caitlyn Jennerat the ESPY awards, he can get away withone of these bullshit claps. It's called clapping, Favre! What the [bleep] are you doing?You washing your hands? You're either on boardor you're not, bro. Now, if he's gonna bring shameon someone, then he can havehis privilege checked, and have a little shamebrought down on him! You want me to shameBrett Favre? No. 'Cause there's somebodyeven worse now. [ Noisemakers blow ] Aah! What the [bleep] dude?!What the [bleep] [ Grunting, squealing ]\n\n[ Groaning ] [ Crowd cheering,whistle blows ] [ Echoing ]I may be down, but I'm not out. Tom Brady's never out. [ Echoing ]You broke the rules! [Bleep] you I broke the rules.You're breaking the rules. [Bleep] you.You broke the rules. You broke the rules how youfound out I broke the rules. [ Echoing ]Yeah, you broke the rules! I'm the commissioner. I canbreak the rules 'cause you guys broke the rules beforebut I didn't bust you enough.

Butters! I'm here, Eric. Oh, Butters. I've livedsuch a horrible life, always doingwhatever I want and claiming itto be for integrity. Butters? Yes, Eric? I'm never going backto the person I was. I swear to God. From now on,the world is going to know a new and betterEric Cartman.\n\n[ Doorbell rings ] Will you please tell your dadto leave me alone? Dude, what happened? Your dad was on my lawnyelling at me all night, and after I finallyfell asleep, I woke up Saran-wrappedto a tree with peniseson my face. And this. Hang on. Dad, did you draw dickson my friend's face? Did I check his privilege?Yes. I had some refreshments, and I checkedyour friend's privilege. That's my best friend, Dad. Stop shaming himbecause you want to fit in. Stan, straight white malesin a capitalistic society have little...understandingof victimization compared to injustices...against underprivileged. Dicks on your faceis a very first-world problem. [ Retches ]Oh, shit! Look, Kyle,maybe you should just say Caitlyn Jenneris a hero. I didn't even sayshe wasn't a hero! I just saidshe isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenneras a person when he wason the Kardashians, and I don't suddenlylike him now. P.C. FRAT BOY:Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Her. Her! Yes! [ Grunts ]\n\nI want to get out there and start makingpositive changes, but I can barely even walk. How is everybody doing? Well, they're fine. Everyone's just kind of keepingtheir mouths shut. It's kind of nice. So the P.C. guysare leaving people alone. Well, except for... Who? Well -- Well, now they've madeKyle their main target. \u266a\u266a Kyle? My friend Kyle? Eric,what are you doing? I don't have a choice. I have to takethese P.C. people out. Oh, but I thoughtyou agreed with them. I do,but I have to help Kyle even if I don't agree withhis hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's viewmay be warped. I personally thinkCaitlyn Jenner'sa stunning hero. [ Clears throat ] But that doesn't meanI'll stand by while Kyle's intoleranceis dealt with violently. We're going to war with theseP.C. people once and for all. Butters, I'm going to need200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers. Well, okay!\n\nI wanna be P.C.!Whoo, whoo! It's just the way to be for me! And you!Whoo, whoo! Your hateful slurs are through!Whoo, whoo! I call whoo, whooon you! Whoo, whoo! We'll fight untilyou're P.C. black and blue! Whoo, whoo! We are language policefighting bigotry! Hurtful wordscan suck our turds, 'cause it's P.C. for me! -And you!-Whoo, whoo! -Yeah!-[Bleep] yeah, bro! -[Bleep] yeah!-[Bleep] yeah!

The pregnant Mexican womenare falling asleep on the tacos. Jared needs backup.Send in the Chinese drivers. [ Tires screech ] Aaah! Alright, the Syrian refugees aretrying to protect theirchildren. Oh [bleep] there's Kyle. What the [bleep]are you doing, Kyle? [ Screaming,explosions continue ] Enough! Stop! Everyone stop! This is so wrong!I can't let it continue. This is not everwhat I intended. I just want to say... Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. There's no other way to say it. What she did took bravery,and she is absolutely stunning. [ Applause ] Whoo-hoo!

Shame on us."], ["http://thehilltalk.com/2015/09/07/former-clinton-aide-pleads-the-fifth-not-cooperating-with-investigators/", "Former Clinton aide pleads the Fifth, not cooperating with investigators", "Former Clinton IT specialist Bryan Pagliano has informed the House Benghazi Select Committee that he will be invoking his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions regarding the secret private email server that Hillary Clinton used while Secretary of State.\n\nHowever, in an August 31 letter to Congress, Pagliano\u2019s attorney said the former 2008 campaign staffer who installed and managed Clinton\u2019s personal server and left his IT job at the State Department in February 2013, the same month Clinton stepped down as secretary, would \u201crespectfully assert his Fifth Amendment right\u201d before the Benghazi Select Committee. \u201cThe matters for which Mr. Pagliano\u2019s testimony and documents are being sought by the Select Committee are also the subject of investigative activity by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice,\u201d the letter said.\n\nDespite using the investigations by the FBI and DOJ as the reason to plead the Fifth, it has been reported that Pagliano is refusing to cooperate with investigators from either probe. Apparently this follows a pattern of refusals to cooperate that go back as far as the original inspector general investigation back in the early summer.\n\nPagliano had worked with Clinton going back to at least 2006, serving on her original presidential campaign then later at the State Department with continuing duties overseeing the email server. Last week Clinton claimed to have used the secret private email server going back at least to her time as senator from New York:\n\n\u201cI did all my business on my personal email [in the Senate],\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI was not thinking a lot when I got in [to the State Department]. There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world.

Since then, he\u2019s driven the GOP field further right on immigration issues, in part with his aggressive proposal to have Mexico pay for a wall along the border with the U.S. and to deport 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in short order.\n\nWhile many activists find his comments downright offensive, they also see an opportunity. Trump has managed to get Latinos engaged with the 2016 race, and activists plan to exploit that to the fullest extent possible.\n\n\u201cHe really is just outrageous, he\u2019s built his entire campaign on attacking our community and really playing to the worst element of American society,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n, president of the Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit membership organization. \u201cIn some ways, he\u2019s helping us out, the base is energized \u2014I think people are really eager to stand up and say this is not who we are and show that through our electoral process.\u201d\n\nCalder\u00f3n said in nonelection years, the Federation, which represents 100 community-based organizations across the country and is leading voter outreach efforts, can register about 25,000 Hispanics and on election years it\u2019s about 60,000. But with Trump\u2019s comments driving people to the polls, Calder\u00f3n believes they can register even more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become easier, right, to do it now. The community is very mobilized, there is this anger,\u201d Calder\u00f3n said. \u201cWe will respond in kind, through our votes.\u201d\n\nFor the 2016 race, the organization has partnered with 20 member organizations across the U.S. in order to increase direct contact with Hispanic communities. Calder\u00f3n expects to triple previous outreach in this coming cycle, bringing it to 600,000.\n\nEfforts are going to really crank up on Tuesday, when the White House will make Voto Latino\u2019s \u201cVoter Registration Day\u201d official. The nonpartisan organization, along with 2,000 partners across the country, plans to increase outreach through social media, door-to-door canvassing, tabling and online campaigns to encourage everyone \u2014 not just Hispanics \u2014 to vote.\n\nDespite his inflammatory comments, Trump does have some reservoir of support among Hispanics. According to a Marist poll released earlier this week, 13 percent of Latino voters had a \u201cvery positive\u201d or \u201csomewhat positive\u201d view of the real estate mogul. (The poll also showed that 70 percent had a \u201csomewhat negative\u201d or \u201cvery negative\u201d view.)\n\nTrump also has taken an effort to reach out to the Hispanic community, meeting with Palomarez, the Hispanic Chamber CEO, on Sept. 1. The two agreed to have Trump participate in a public Q&A with the Chamber on Oct. 8.\n\nBut while Trump has proclaimed \"the Hispanics love me,\" he will not likely be the beneficiary of any big Hispanic voter turnout, with the Marist poll showing that Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio with the most positive sentiment.\n\nIncreasing voter turnout in the Hispanic community has been a consistent challenge for activists. While the number of eligible voters continues to swell (the Pew Research Center told POLITICO it goes up 3 million to 3.5 million between every presidential election), the rate doesn\u2019t necessarily match the increase.\n\nThe Hispanic voter turnout rate actually declined between 2008 and 2012, from 49.9 percent to 48 percent, according to Mark Lopez, director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center.\n\nHe sees multiple reasons why.\n\nThe rapid increase in eligible voters is due to youth coming of age, and Lopez says many of them just don\u2019t know how and where to register, the same way young people of all demographics may not have the information. Lopez also sees a trend related to where the majority of Hispanics live. He said half of Hispanics live in two states, California and Texas, neither of which have been swing states in the past two elections. If you add New York and Illinois, two-thirds of Hispanics don\u2019t live in swing or battleground states, and that means the candidates just aren\u2019t advertising in or traveling to the state the way they would if the area was key for voting.\n\n\u201cHispanics just may not be getting the attention from candidates that you might expect if that state were a swing state,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nInterviews with multiple Hispanic groups show they\u2019re stepping up outreach to their base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re taking very personally,\u201d said Voto Latino President and CEO Maria Teresa Kumar. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit by the sidelines and there is no clearer way than to demonstrate to our fellow Americans that we\u2019re Americans than by participating.\u201d\n\nVoto Latino launched a series of events to engage voters for Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. The group, which largely focuses on millennials, has concerts and other events on college campuses planned thoughout the month and announced a partnership with Instagram called the #HispanicHeritageHero campaign. The goal is for people to post their Hispanic heroes on Instagram using the hashtag and then pledge to vote in their honor, Kumar said.\n\nHispanic celebrities also are joining the cause. Comedian George Lopez and singer Lila Downs will have voter registration at each stop on their tours as part of the campaign.\n\nAhead of the CNN debate last Wednesday, Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Linda S\u00e1nchez and Congressman Mark Takano joined AFSCME, Latino Victory Project, Mi Familia Vota, United We Dream Action and the NCLR Action Fund to issue a \u201cgrito,\u201d or call to action, for the Hispanic community to get engaged with the political process to make both political parties compete for the Hispanic vote.\n\nMany organizers say there's a precedent for the Trump effect they're currently seeing, pointing to Proposition 187 in California in 1994. The ballot initiative, which was supported by Pete Wilson, the Republican governor at that time, would have kept illegal immigrants from attending public school and medical care. Although the proposition was approved (it was ultimately thrown out by the court), Hispanics turned out in droves and many credit the initiative with turning the state blue.\n\nThe Trump camp is not worried, and it says it sees more Hispanic voters as a good thing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear any empirical evidence that that is going to happen,\u201d campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said about the idea that more Hispanic voters could hurt his chances. \u201cThe more people that take part in the election process, the better, and I think it\u2019s clear that Mr. Trump has invigorated people who aren\u2019t traditionally participating in the process.\u201d\n\nLewandowski cited Trump\u2019s massive rallies, \u201cwhere he gets the biggest audiences and the largest applause\u201d as a reason the businessman will be just fine. \u201cI think this is great, poll after poll continue to show that Hispanics are supporting Mr. Trump at a disproportionate rate to any of the other candidates.\u201d\n\nHispanic activists don't agree. Henry R. Mu\u00f1oz III, co-founder of the Latino Victory Fund, thinks Trump\u2019s rhetoric is not just problematic for Trump, but for the other GOP candidates, too.\n\nWhile other candidates have not come close to matching Trump's incendiary comments about immigrants, some have stumbled when talking about Hispanics. For example, On Thursday, in what appeared to be a convoluted attempt to thank the Latino community, Ohio Gov. John Kasich associated them with a hotel maid he talked to when he needed soap.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted in Spanish about Kasich's comments, saying they were the product of the Party of Trump.\n\nMu\u00f1oz shared the sentiment. \u201cHe is taking every single candidate in the Republican Party, marching them, they are following him down the road that is completely disrespectful of the fastest demographic in the country,\u201d he said.\n\n"], ["http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/09/20/1422655/-Sunday-Talk-Reality-star-wars?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dailykos%2Findex+%28Daily+Kos%29", "Reality star wars", "But alas , 'twas not to be .\n\nMorning lineup:\n\nMeet the Press: Raging Narcissist Donald Trump (R); Ohio Gov.

That could end up being the epitaph of America and the free world.\"\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nBristol Palin demanded that President Obama abstain from talking about Ahmed Mohamed.\n\nBristol Palin wrote on her blog Thursday that President Obama \"needs to STAY out of\" the case of a 14-year-old Muslim student in Texas who was wrongly arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school. Obama invited the teen, Ahmed Mohamed, to the White House on Wednesday after news of his arrest went viral. [...] But Palin, the daughter of former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, said the invitation was a mistake:\n\nThis is the kind of stuff Obama needs to STAY out of. This encourages more racial strife that is already going on with the \"Black Lives Matter\" crowd and encourages victimhood. The police made a mistake, clearly. But why put more people against them? Why egg it on? Childish games like this from our president have divided our country\u2026 even more today than when he was elected.\n\nAnd, proving that the rotten apple didn't fall far from the tree...\n\nMama grizzly Sarah Palin proclaimed that if Ahmed Mohamed isn't really a bomb-making terrorist, then she's the Queen of England.\n\nIn a winding Friday night post, Palin aired her suspicions that the \"obstinate-answering\" boy was really up to no good and Irving police and school officials have been wrongly maligned in the \"reactionary-slash-biased media!\" The case has generated outrage amid the belief that Mohamed was arrested due to anti-Muslim bias and not any genuine threat posed. \"Yep, believing that's a clock in a school pencil box is like believing Barack Obama is ruling over the most transparent administration in history. Right. That's a clock, and I'm the Queen of England,\" Palin opined. Throughout the post, she spelled Mohamed's name \"Muhammad,\" which is the spelling commonly used in the English-speaking world for the prophet of Islam. \"Friends, consider the kids disciplined and/or kicked out of school for bringing squirt guns to school or taking bites out of a pop tart until it resembled (to some politically correct yahoo) a gun,\" Palin rambled. \"Or the student out deer hunting with his dad early one morning who forgot he had a box of ammo in his truck when he parked in the school's lot later that day. Kids humiliated and intimidated for innocent actions like those real examples are often marked the rest of their lives and made to feel really rotten. Whereas Ahmed Muhammad, an evidently obstinate-answering student bringing in a homemade \"clock\" that obviously could be seen by conscientious teachers as a dangerous wired-up bomb-looking contraption (teachers who are told \"if you see something, say something!\") gets invited to the White House.\"\n\nKill me now.\n\n- Trix"], ["http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/republican-2016-straw-poll-mackinac-island-213856", "Republicans 2016: Rand Paul wins Michigan straw poll", "Associated Press Rand Paul wins Michigan straw poll The Kentucky senator tops Carly Fiorina by 7 percentage points.\n\nMACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. \u2013 Rand Paul won the straw poll at the Mackinac Island Republican Leadership Conference, a show of organizational strength for a candidate who has seen his presidential hopes fade.\n\nPaul led with 22 percent, followed by Carly Fiorina with 15 percent, John Kasich with 13 percent, and Ted Cruz with 12 percent.

Heading up his straw poll efforts was John Yob, Paul\u2019s national political director and a Michigan-based Republican strategist in Michigan who is well versed in political organizing. Yob had spent weeks preparing for the straw poll, pushing many of the senator\u2019s activist-minded supporters to cast votes at the conference.\n\nSupporters for Cruz, meanwhile, sought to tilt the vote in his favor by spray-painting the candidate\u2019s name on the sidewalk leading up to the stately Grand Hotel, where the three-day conference is held.\n\n\n\nKasich had perhaps the most visible presence, with aides handing out T-shirts to supporters and setting up a booth offering goodies like bumper stickers.

Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

We\u2019re going to be talking about generalities, stereotypes, and manipulation of the truth perpetrated by both the right and the left. Some of this is certainly going to sting a portion of our readers.\n\nThere are four groups of politically-minded people in this country.\n\nThoughtful Conservatives: These are often seen as the \u201cintellectual conservatives\u201d who take every situation individually to determine a perspective. That\u2019s not to say that one has to be highly intelligent or educated to be a thoughtful conservative (look at me, for example), but one cannot blindly follow a pundit just because they have some conservative views. The thoughtful conservatives are the ones who recognize that the Republican party\u2019s \u201cvictories\u201d in the last two elections have not done anything to move Congress towards conservative doctrines. It\u2019s just more of the same and that makes us upset. Ignorant Conservatives: Again, this has nothing to do with IQ. It\u2019s about blindly following a leader, accepting a platform, or relaying a talking point without investigating the reasoning behind their source. They are the ones who still adore George W. Bush despite several actions that were very liberal. They love to listen to Rush Limbaugh, an entertainer who has conservative tendencies rather than someone who is a true conservative. That\u2019s not to say that Limbaugh or other ignorant conservatives are necessarily wrong; in most circumstances they\u2019re right because of the ideology they profess to follow. However, they are more Republican than conservative. Thoughtful Liberals: These are the most enigmatic of the group. They are intelligent enough to recognize the fallacies of liberalism but willfully ignore these realities for ideological reasons. These reasons are diverse. Perhaps they are intelligent but atheist and therefore identify with fellow leftist atheists. Maybe they realize that the popular perspective of leftism makes life easier, especially if they\u2019re a politician. It could even be righteous indignation driven by an education system that has indoctrinated many intellectuals into the realms of liberal thought. For whatever reason, they are able to feign free thinking but their actions are geared towards mass appeal. Ignorant Liberals: This is the most common of the four groups. They are liberal because it\u2019s easy. They are followers because the media has given them all of the ammunition they need to maintain their ignorance.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that I did not include independents. The idea of being an independent is only relevant when discussing Republicans and Democrats, not when discussing conservatives and liberals. Even if someone is a mix such as fiscally conservative but socially liberal, they still lean in one direction or another as a whole. If someone\u2019s views are 49.9% conservative and 50.1% liberal, then they\u2019re a moderate liberal.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the importance of separating thoughtful conservatives and ignorant ones. This has never been too much of an issue in the past. The rise of Donald Trump makes this particular election cycle very different. We\u2019ve always held to Reagan\u2019s 11th commandment, but that doesn\u2019t seem possible this time around. Current polls show that Trump is in the lead. Since he is very clearly not the right person to lead the party nor the country, one has to assume that his greatest appeal is to the ignorant branch of the conservative movement.\n\nWe cannot stress this enough: being an ignorant conservative has nothing to do with intelligence level. It\u2019s about a pure vulnerability to the talk tracks of Republicans that enable the masses to rally around an idea regardless of whether it\u2019s real or not. Donald Trump is making promises that are absolutely and insanely impossible to keep. He possess neither the skill nor the intelligence to make things happen the way he has planned. In many ways, his platforms echo very closely to the same types of promises that candidate Barack Obama was making in 2007. Just as he was unable to meet the majority of his campaign promises, so too will Trump be unable to fulfill his.\n\nHe\u2019s an entertainer, much like Limbaugh. He\u2019s great at rallying the masses but he won\u2019t be able to deliver the goods.\n\nBreaking through to the ignorant side of the conservative movement is going to be a challenge, but for the first time in decades it\u2019s an imperative. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to end up with something worse than a do-little Congress. We\u2019re going to end up with a do-nothing President."], ["http://act.credoaction.com/sign/PP_Hold_the_Line?sp_ref=150161154.4.15659.t.64876.2&referring_akid=15630.3213525.DpX_M5&source=tw_sp", "Democrats can\u2019t compromise when it comes to Planned Parenthood", "\"Democrats in Congress must stand strong against any Republican attacks on women.

[...] But Palin, the daughter of former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, said the invitation was a mistake:\n\nThis is the kind of stuff Obama needs to STAY out of. This encourages more racial strife that is already going on with the \"Black Lives Matter\" crowd and encourages victimhood. The police made a mistake, clearly. But why put more people against them?

Right. That's a clock, and I'm the Queen of England,\" Palin opined. Throughout the post, she spelled Mohamed's name \"Muhammad,\" which is the spelling commonly used in the English-speaking world for the prophet of Islam. \"Friends, consider the kids disciplined and/or kicked out of school for bringing squirt guns to school or taking bites out of a pop tart until it resembled (to some politically correct yahoo) a gun,\" Palin rambled. \"Or the student out deer hunting with his dad early one morning who forgot he had a box of ammo in his truck when he parked in the school's lot later that day.

Heading up his straw poll efforts was John Yob, Paul\u2019s national political director and a Michigan-based Republican strategist in Michigan who is well versed in political organizing. Yob had spent weeks preparing for the straw poll, pushing many of the senator\u2019s activist-minded supporters to cast votes at the conference.\n\nSupporters for Cruz, meanwhile, sought to tilt the vote in his favor by spray-painting the candidate\u2019s name on the sidewalk leading up to the stately Grand Hotel, where the three-day conference is held.\n\n\n\nKasich had perhaps the most visible presence, with aides handing out T-shirts to supporters and setting up a booth offering goodies like bumper stickers.

Walker, another Midwestern governor, did not seriously compete in the straw poll. The Wisconsin governor had been scheduled to deliver a Saturday morning speech but cancelled because, his campaign said, inclement weather interrupted his flight plans.\n\nFiorina, riding a wave of momentum following her debate performance, drew hordes of supporters to the hotel on Saturday evening.

Nearly 600 homes and 40,000 acres in Northern California in a matter of hours last weekend.\n\nAs the West endures one of the most destructive and alarming fire seasons in history, the way Congress funds wildfire response is actually making the problem worse.\n\nIn order to compensate for inadequate wildfire funding levels provided by Congress, federal agencies have been forced to divert $700 million from forest restoration and management funds \u2014 efforts which would help prevent wildfires to begin with!\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has proposed the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would finally treat wildfires as disasters and adequately fund response.1 The heads of President Obama\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Management and Budget have called on Congress to pass the bill, and they should.2\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nRising temperatures and enduring drought are making wildfires increasingly expensive and destructive: For the first time this year the Forest Service is spending more than 50% of of it\u2019s budget on firefighting efforts, up from just 1/6th in 1995.\n\nIt goes without saying, adequately funding catastrophic wildfire fighting is a band-aid response to a much bigger problem: That a majority in Congress are obstructing action to limit the very pollution which is almost literally fanning the flames of wildfires. Whether it is irony, denial, or both, many of the Republican sponsors of this wildfire bill are some of the worst climate deniers in Congress; western Republican senators like Mike Enzi, Mike Crapo, and John Barrasso.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make passing the bill any less important. But the rising cost of wildfires does make more indefensible the $11 billion in subsidies we give to fossil fuel companies every year.3\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nThe present and future of wildfires is truly terrifying.3 Global warming is creating a vicious, amplifying cycle for fire destruction: drought and higher temperatures pull moisture out of the forest, leading to increasingly destructive megafires. These fires release massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere, amplifying the warming.\n\nIn a new piece in Rolling Stone, journalist Tim Dickinson lays out the stark reality: Present levels of carbon pollution have already baked in what is estimated to be a sixfold increase in wildfires within 35 years. With current fire suppression capacity already maxed out, \u201cAmerica finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire.\u201d4\n\nAgainst this backdrop, (and Republican cries of deficit reduction), there is simply no excuse to continue giving billions of dollars a year in corporate welfare and tax breaks to the hugely profitable fossil fuel industry burning our country down. The need to transition away from fossil fuels couldn\u2019t be more urgent, yet we are subsidizing the mature fossil fuel industry at nearly six times the rate of the emerging renewable industry.\n\nOf course, a majority in this Congress still denies that there\u2019s anything wrong with burning fossil fuels, so repealing fossil fuel subsidies before the next fire season is a longshot. But with the rare possibility of bipartisan agreement on a needed budget fix, we need to build momentum to address escalating wildfires and phase out the fossil fuels making them more destructive.\n\nTell Congress: Pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act\u2026 and repeal fossil fuel subsidies to pay for it.\n\nSources:\n\n1. \"Senators Pledge to Work Together on Wildfire Funding,\" Senate Budget Committee\n\n2. \"USDA, DOI, and OMB Urge Congress to Fix the Fire Budget,\" USDA, 9/15/15\n\n3. \"End Polluter Welfare Act,\" Sen.

Trump says he has yet to fully exploit his personal advantages over his Republican presidential rivals \u2014 chiefly his enormous wealth and celebrity \u2014 and that both will matter more to his political fate than debate performances like his shaky one this week.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump said in an interview that he was prepared to spend $100 million or more to become the Republican nominee and that most of it would go to galvanizing voter support in states with early nominating contests.\u201d\n\nRemember when Republicans tried to accuse then sitting Senator Barack Obama of being a \u201ccelebrity\u201d? LOL. They are getting that handed back to them on a big old plate of payback.\n\nPeople (and by people, Trump is referring to Republican primary voters) don\u2019t care about his policies; they just want to hear him be angry according to Trump.\n\n\u201cHe said he did not give many specific answers at the debate because he believed that most people cared more about seeing his pugnacious leadership style than hearing detailed policy plans. He denied that he was unprepared for foreign policy questions, saying that he had received briefings from national security officials (whom he would not name), but that he preferred to speak in \u201cbroad strokes\u201d about his views,\u201d the New York Times reported.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cviews\u201d, like his birtherism, his hatred of immigrants, his belief that Mexicans are all rapists, the nasty things he says about professional women with whom he is interacting\u2026 Yes, those views are the views that the Republican base loves to see on display.\n\nIronically, those views are also the carefully cultivated views that Republican establishment plants in their base in order to avoid discussing actual policies with them, so the horror of Trump\u2019s popularity is simply the natural evolution of the Republican Party\u2019s Southern Strategy. This is what it takes to sell a debunked economic policy that is designed specifically to benefit the top 2% at the expense of the very people whose votes they need.\n\nSarah Palin was a 2008 warning shot to Republicans to get it together, but they decided to blame her and carry on in deep denial, pretending all was well. Then in 2012 they took refuge in establishment pedigree with Mitt Romney, who hates half the country. But even he couldn\u2019t sell the people the knife with which to stab themselves in the back. So now here they are, eight years later, caught between Donald Trump and Jeb Bush \u2013 or Sarah Palin with less knowledge of government (God help us all) and Mitt Romney with George W. Bush\u2019s last name and the foreign policy posse to back up all that the Bush name stands for.\n\nTo make it rain trickle down, Trump will just have to keep insulting everyone but white, hetero Christian males and those who identify with them."], ["https://www.pinterest.com/pin/28851253840013262/", "John F Kennedy on the source of #NaturaLRights& #NaturalLaw #Millennials #Boomers #GenX #Teen @GOP @TheDemcorats #P2 https://twitter.com/DMashak/st\u2026", "Oh no!

Scott Walker boasted that he \u201ctook on union bosses from Washington\u201d in his 2011 effort to crush state public-employee union rights.\n\nBut according to a stunning, detailed new statement by a former top Republican legislative aide, it turns out that Walker isolated himself and hid in tightly controlled, heavily-guarded environments during the conflict covering six intense weeks in early 2011\u2014which directly contradicts his tall tale of courageously facing his adversaries.\n\n\u201cOur unintimidated governor continued to only participate in private events with the media excluded or tightly controlled,\u201d wrote Michael Boerger, former top aide to retired Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis, in a September 10 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion piece.\n\nUnintimidated is the title of Walker\u2019s fact-challenged biography that recounts fiercely battling tens of thousands of pro-labor advocates as he pushed Act 10 into law. The legislation stripped most Wisconsin employees of any practical rights to union representation.\n\nWalker\u2019s reliance on his oft-told tale of political courage did not help deliver a breakout performance to counter his slipping poll numbers at Wednesday\u2019s debate. But Boerger\u2019s astonishing account of a man who hid from his critics and the public\u2014but later boasted of facing down enemies\u2014could mark a turning point for his 2016 ambitions.\n\nAs Boerger noted in his recent Milwaukee Journal Sentinel op-ed, while Walker sat quivering in fear, Madison police reported virtually no violence despite crowds of up to 150,000 protesters who stayed peaceful throughout the protracted battle over the legislation.\n\nWalker is a promoting a national anti-labor agenda as a cornerstone of his presidential campaign. In March, he signed a \u201cright-to-work\u201d bill for Wisconsin despite repeated assurances to the public and in private to conservative labor leaders that such a bill would never reach his desk. More recently, he has called for federal right-to-work laws, which discourage union membership and suppress wages, banning federal employee unions and closing the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nEven those who know Walker best are not impressed with his latest anti-union plans. Milwaukee\u2019s Journal Sentinel, a conservative paper which endorsed Walker three times for governor, dismissed his call for \u201cAct 10 nationwide\u201d and basically called him a serial liar.\n\n\u201cIt is more politicking from a governor who as recently as last year when running for re-election called right-to-work a distraction, then proceeded to sign the legislation anyway when it passed the Legislature,\u201d it editorialized. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growing distrust of Walker are Boerger\u2019s revelations that reveal Walker was hardly \u201cunintimidated\u201d in confronting unions. Last winter, candidate Walker ridiculously said that his battle with unionists showed that he could stand up to ISIS terrorists.\n\nWalker has also repeatedly said that he showed leadership by pushing Republican legislative leaders to fully support Act 10, which Boerger resented. His op-ed opened, \u201cAs a front-row witness to the sad history of the passage of Act 10, I have to refute the notion currently being advanced by Gov. Scott Walker that he faced stiff opposition to his proposal from GOP legislative leaders.\u201d\n\nBoerger\u2019s comments reflect the bitterness of Republicans who feel that they took the brunt of criticism from voters and were forced to engage in extraordinary anti-democratic tactics to prevent a high-profile loss for the new governor under an international spotlight\u2014as the Madison rebellion coincided with a popular uprising in Egypt and captured international headlines and TV coverage. Despite the GOP legislators\u2019 willingness to bend the rules to pass Act 10 for Walker, they saw themselves as unappreciated by the governor.\n\n\u201cEvery day that spring, legislators had to run a gantlet of protesters and meet in public in the Capitol for committee meetings and legislative sessions,\u201d stated Boerger. \u201cMeanwhile, our unintimidated governor was making speeches in minutely controlled, private venues that often even excluded attendance by the media.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Walker was so petrified of any direct challenge that he initially planned to deliver his high-profile budget address away from the State Capitol in a more tightly-guarded site, Boerger said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, the governor even planned to give his budget address outside the Capitol in such a private, security-dominated venue. Unintimidated? It was GOP leaders who convinced the governor to appear in public, in the statehouse as every other governor has done.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first account that has revealed Walker\u2019s self-described profile in courage as a big lie. While Republican legislators often faced protesters in heated dialogue as they circulated around the Capitol, Walker remained cloistered in his heavily-guarded office and \u201cslunk to and from the state Capitol via underground tunnels\u201d with armed escorts, Guardian journalist Jeb Lund reported.\n\nAs Walker\u2019s presidential ambitions keep floundering, it is beginning to appear that he is fated to return his bunker at the Capitol\u2014where he hid when he first launched his attack on labor and nurtured his presidential ambitions. But this time, he would be hiding from everyone who he used to fan his presidential ambitions."], ["http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/republican-2016-straw-poll-mackinac-island-213856?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "Republicans 2016: Rand Paul wins Michigan straw poll", "Associated Press Rand Paul wins Michigan straw poll The Kentucky senator tops Carly Fiorina by 7 percentage points.\n\nMACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. \u2013 Rand Paul won the straw poll at the Mackinac Island Republican Leadership Conference, a show of organizational strength for a candidate who has seen his presidential hopes fade.\n\nPaul led with 22 percent, followed by Carly Fiorina with 15 percent, John Kasich with 13 percent, and Ted Cruz with 12 percent.

And in the months that followed, millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes, and the savings they\u2019d worked so hard to build.\n\nToday\u2019s a different story. Over the past five and a half years, our businesses have created more than 13 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is lower than it\u2019s been in over seven years. Manufacturing is growing. Housing is bouncing back. We\u2019ve reduced our deficits by two-thirds. And 16 million more Americans now know the security of health insurance.\n\nThis is your progress.
